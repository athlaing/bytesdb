            "Make Dough Brush a large bowl with butter. Whisk yeast and 1/4 cup very warm water (110\u00b0F\u2013115\u00b0F) in another large bowl to dissolve. Let stand until yeast starts to foam, about 5 minutes. Add 3 cups flour, 3 tablespoons sugar, 1 teaspoon salt, 2 tablespoons butter, and 3/4 cup cold water. Mix until a shaggy dough forms. Turn out onto a lightly floured surface and knead, adding flour as needed, until dough is supple, soft, and slightly tacky, about 5 minutes.",

            "Proof Dough Twice Place dough in prepared bowl and turn to coat with butter. Cover bowl with plastic wrap, place in a warm, draft-free spot, and let dough rise until doubled in size, 1\u20131 1/2 hours. (This process of resting and rising is known as proofing.) Punch down dough and knead lightly a few times inside bowl. Cover again with plastic wrap and chill in refrigerator until dough is again doubled in size, 45\u201360 minutes.",

            "Shape & Chill Dough Turn out dough onto a lightly floured surface and pat into a 6x6\" square. Wrap in plastic and chill in freezer until dough is very firm but not frozen, 30\u201335 minutes. (Heads up: You'll want it to be about as firm as the chilled butter block in step 5.)",

            "Wrap & Chill Butter Block Neatly wrap up butter, pressing out air. Roll packet gently with a rolling pin to push butter into corners and create an evenly thick rectangle. Chill in refrigerator until firm but pliable, 25\u201330 minutes.",

            "Roll Out Dough & Enclose Butter Block Roll out dough on a lightly floured surface into a 19x7\" rectangle (a bit wider and about 50 percent longer than the butter block). Place butter block on upper two-thirds of dough, leaving a thin border along top and sides. Fold dough like a letter: Bring lower third of dough up and over lower half of butter. Then fold exposed upper half of butter and dough over lower half (butter should bend, not break). Press edges of dough to seal, enclosing butter.",
