            "1 All-Purpose Crust, Oat Variation",
            "2 tablespoons seedless raspberry jam, warmed",
            "4 eggs",
            "1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract",
            "1 1/4 cups evaporated milk",
            "1/2 cup reduced-fat peanut butter",
            "1/4 cup packed light brown sugar",
            "1 cup mini-marshmallows",
            "1 pint fresh raspberries"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Heat oven to 350\u00b0F. Chill crust 15 minutes. Remove from fridge; prick crust at 1-inch intervals with a fork. Line with waxed paper; fill with pie weights or uncooked rice. Bake until golden, 30 minutes. When crust is cool, lift waxed paper to remove weights. Increase oven heat to 400\u00b0F. Spread jam on crust to cover bottom. In a bowl, whisk eggs and vanilla. In a thick-bottomed pot (to prevent burning), whisk milk with peanut butter and sugar over medium heat until steaming; remove from heat. Whisk peanut butter mixture into egg-vanilla mixture until combined; spoon filling into crust. Bake until filling is set at edges but center jiggles when you shake pan, 15 minutes. Heat broiler. Top pie with marshmallows; broil, rotating once or twice for even browning, until marshmallows are puffed and golden, 1 to 2 minutes. Let cool for at least 3 hours. Top with raspberries and serve."
