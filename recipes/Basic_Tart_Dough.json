            "1 tablespoon sugar",
            "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt",
            "1 cup all-purpose flour, plus more for surface",

            "Whisk sugar, salt, and 1 cup flour in a medium bowl. Add butter and rub in with your fingers until mixture resembles coarse meal with a few pea-size pieces remaining. Drizzle egg over butter mixture and mix gently with a fork until dough just comes together. Turn out dough onto a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth (a few dry spots are okay). Form dough into a disk. Wrap in plastic and chill until firm, at least 2 hours. Do ahead: Dough can be made 2 days ahead. Keep chilled, or freeze up to 1 month.",
