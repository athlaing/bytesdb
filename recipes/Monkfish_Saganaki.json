        "ingredients": [
            "1 small fennel bulb (sometimes called anise) with fronds",
            "1 (4- to 5-inch-long) fresh red chile, chopped, including seeds",
            "2 scallions, finely chopped",
            "1/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil",
            "2/3 cup Chardonnay or other dry white wine",
            "8 (1/4-lb) pieces monkfish fillet (about 1 1/2 inches thick), trimmed of all membranes",
            "1/4 lb feta (preferably Greek), crumbled"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Cut stalks from fennel bulb and reserve 4 fronds for garnish, then discard stalks. Halve bulb lengthwise, core, and thinly slice crosswise.",
            "Saut\u00e9 fennel, chile, and scallions in oil in a 12-inch heavy skillet over moderately high heat, stirring occasionally, until fennel begins to soften, 4 to 5 minutes. Add wine and bring to a boil.",
            "Season fish with salt and pepper and add to fennel mixture. Cook, covered, over high heat until fish is just cooked through, 5 to 6 minutes. Remove lid and sprinkle feta over fish and cooking liquid, then cook, swirling skillet frequently, just until cheese is melted and sauce is creamy, 1 to 2 minutes (do not let boil). Serve fish immediately, with sauce spooned over it. Garnish with fennel fronds."
