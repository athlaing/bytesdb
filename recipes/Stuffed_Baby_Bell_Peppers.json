        "instructions": [
            "Cook onion and anchovies in oil in a heavy skillet over moderate heat, stirring frequently, until onion is golden, about 8 minutes. (Anchovies will dissolve.) Transfer to a bowl and stir in bread crumbs, cheeses, capers, eggs, and parsley until combined well.",
            "Stuff and bake peppers: Preheat oven to 350\u00b0F. Cut tops from baby peppers (keep stems on tops) and reserve. Cut a very thin slice from bottom of each pepper so it can stand upright (don't worry if you make a hole in bottom). Scoop out and discard seeds, then divide filling among peppers. Cover with reserved tops and arrange peppers upright in an oiled baking dish. Add water to dish and drizzle peppers with oil. Bake, uncovered, in middle of oven until peppers are tender and filling is puffed, 50 to 60 minutes.",
