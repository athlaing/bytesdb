        "ingredients": [
            "2 cups (340 g) shelled and frozen edamame",
            "1 can (15 ounces, or 420 g) chickpeas, with liquid",
            "8 ounces (227 g) sliced mushrooms",

        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Place the frozen edamame and the entire can of chickpeas, including the liquid, in a saucepot and warm through. This step is to defrost the edamame; if you use fresh or precooked edamame, you can skip this step.",
            "Combine the edamame, chickpeas and liquid, mushrooms, cashews, yeast, garlic, cumin, liquid smoke, liquid aminos, and salt and pepper in a food processor and process until smooth. Pour into a large bowl.",
            "Slowly add the flour until a thicker consistency is formed. Depending on the moisture content of your mixture, you may need just a little flour or a whole lot.",
            "Place the entire bowl in the refrigerator for 20 to 30 minutes to stiffen up and make it easier to handle when forming the patties. Form into 16 patties.",
            "Heat the oil in a saut\u00e9 pan and fry the patties for 4 to 5 minutes, or until golden brown on both sides."
