        "ingredients": [
            "1 (750 ml) bottle light rum",
            "2 tablespoons Sichuan peppercorns",
            "25 ounces pomegranate juice",
            "8 1/2 ounces fresh lemon juice",
            "8 1/2 ounces 1:1 simple syrup (see note)",
            "4 ounces water",
            "GARNISH: ice block, about 20 lemon wheels, 1/4 cup pomegranate seeds, and 1 tablespoon each black and pink peppercorns (optional)"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "At least 24 hours before you plan to serve the punch, fill a Tupperware or cake pan with water and freeze to make an ice block that will fit in your serving vessel, or make several trays of large ice cubes.",
            "Meanwhile, make the infused rum: Carefully spoon Sichuan peppercorns directly into the bottle of rum, using a funnel if desired. Reseal the bottle and let sit at room temperature for 24 hours, jostling occasionally to move the peppercorns around. Strain the infused rum through a fine-mesh strainer and discard peppercorns. If not serving immediately, return the infused rum to the bottle using a funnel and store in a cool, dark place for up to 3 months.",
            "When ready to serve, combine entire bottle of infused rum with the measured pomegranate juice, lemon juice, simple syrup, and water in a large punch bowl. Stir well to mix and carefully add the ice block. Garnish punch bowl with lemon wheels, pomegranate seeds, and peppercorns if using. Ladle into ice-filled punch glasses and garnish each glass with a lemon wheel."
