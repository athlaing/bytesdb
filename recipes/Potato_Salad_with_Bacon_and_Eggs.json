Drain, then let cool slightly (the potatoes should be warm when you dress them, which will help them soak up the dressing). Meanwhile, cook eggs in a large saucepan of boiling water 8 minutes (whites and yolks will be set). Drain; transfer to a bowl of ice water and let cool. Drain, peel, and quarter eggs. Cook bacon in a large skillet over medium heat, turning halfway through, until brown and crisp, 8\u201310 minutes. Transfer bacon to paper towels to drain and let cool slightly. Tear into 1\" pieces. Reserve 2 Tbsp. bacon fat in pan. Whisk mayonnaise, sour cream, relish, mustard, garlic powder, pepper, and remaining 1/2 tsp. salt in a large bowl. Add potatoes, eggs, tomatoes, olives, half of bacon, and reserved bacon fat and fold gently until combined and completely coated. Transfer salad to a platter and top with remaining bacon.",
