        "ingredients": [
            "3 tablespoons fish sauce (such as nam pla or nuoc nam)*",
            "2 tablespoons water",
            "1 1/2 tablespoons (packed) golden brown sugar",
            "1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper",
            "2 tablespoons (1/4 stick) butter",
            "2 tablespoons olive oil, plus additional for brushing corn",
            "1 tablespoon thinly sliced green onions, white part only (from about 3)",
            "6 ears of corn, husked"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Stir first 4 ingredients in small bowl until sugar dissolves. Melt butter with 2 tablespoons oil in small saucepan over medium heat. Add fish sauce mixture and green onions and simmer until sauce begins to thicken, about 2 minutes.",
            "Do ahead: Butter sauce can be made 2 hours ahead. Let stand at room temperature.",
            "Preheat barbecue (medium-high heat). Brush corn with oil. Grill corn until tender and charred in spots, about 13 minutes. Brush corn generously with butter sauce and serve, passing remaining sauce separately.",
            "*Fish sauce is a versatile ingredient. Try it (1) mixed with garlic and cilantro as a marinade for grilled chicken; (2) in barbecue sauce for ribs; (3) in a salad of slivered green apples and chopped cilantro; and (4) in a compound butter with cayenne and shallots for grilled fish. It is available in the Asian foods section of many supermarkets and at Asian markets.",
