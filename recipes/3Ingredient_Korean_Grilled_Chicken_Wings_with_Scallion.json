        "title": "3-Ingredient Korean Grilled Chicken Wings with Scallion ",
        "ingredients": [
            "2 pounds chicken wings (flats and drumettes attached or separated)",
            "1 tablespoon vegetable oil",
            "1 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more",
            "1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, plus more",
            "1/2 cup gochujang (Korean hot pepper paste)",
            "1 scallion, thinly sliced on the bias"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Pat wings very dry with paper towels. Toss wings, oil, 1 tsp. salt, and 1/2 tsp. pepper in a large bowl to coat.",
            "Prepare a grill for two zones, medium and medium-high, or heat a grill pan over medium. Working in batches if necessary, grill wings over medium heat, turning occasionally, until skin is starting to brown and fat is rendering, about 12 minutes. Move wings to medium-high zone of grill or increase heat under grill pan to medium-high. Cook wings, moving to a cooler section of grill or reducing heat if they start to burn, until cooked through, an instant-read thermometer inserted into the flesh but not touching the bone registers 165\u00b0F, and skin is crisp and lightly charred, 5\u201310 minutes.",
            "Meanwhile, whisk gochujang and 1/4 cup hot water in a large bowl.",
            "Transfer wings to bowl with gochujang and toss to coat. Transfer to a platter. Top with scallions, season with salt and pepper, and serve immediately."
