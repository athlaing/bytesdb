            "Cornmeal Crust for one double-crust 9-inch (23-cm) pie",
            "2/3 cup (75 g) slivered almonds, toasted",
            "1/3 cup (65 g) sugar",
            "6 tablespoons (3/4 stick/85 g) unsalted butter, at room temperature",
            "1 large egg",
            "1 tablespoon unbleached all-purpose flour",
            "1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract",
            "3/4 cup (150 g) sugar",
            "3 tablespoons cornstarch",
            "1/4 teaspoon salt",
            "1 1/2 pounds (680 g) fresh rhubarb, chopped into 1-inch (2.5-cm) pieces (about 3 cups; remove any tough strings)",
            "Zest of 1 orange",
            "Egg wash or milk, for glaze",
            "Raw sugar, for garnish"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Preheat the oven to 425\u00b0F (220\u00b0C). On a lightly floured surface, roll out half of the dough into an 11-inch (28-cm) circle about 1/8 to 1/4 inch (3 to 6 mm) thick. Line a 9-inch (23-cm) pie plate with the dough, and trim the overhang to 1 inch (2.5 cm). Refrigerate the crust until ready to bake.",
            "Make the frangipane filling: In a food processor, grind the almonds and sugar until they are sandy. Add the butter, then the egg, flour, and vanilla and mix until smooth.",
            "Make the rhubarb filling: In a large bowl, mix together the sugar, cornstarch, and salt. Add the rhubarb and orange zest and toss to coat.",
            "Spread the frangipane over the bottom crust. Pile the rhubarb filling on top. Brush the pie shell edges with egg wash or milk.",
            "Roll out the other half of the pie crust into an 11-inch (28-cm) circle. Lay the dough over the surface of the pie. Trim the edges and tuck the dough inward or outward, pressing and rolling the bottom and top crust edges together. Crimp them into a decorative edge, brush with egg wash or milk, and sprinkle raw sugar over the top. Cut vents into the top crust to allow steam to escape.",
            "Put the pie on a baking sheet and bake for 20 minutes, rotating once halfway through. Lower the temperature to 350\u00b0F (175\u00b0C) and bake for 30 to 40 minutes more, until the crust is golden and the filling is set (you'll see thick juices bubbling out when it's ready). Remove the pie to cool completely on a wire rack, at least 1 hour.",
            "This pie can be refrigerated for up to 1 week, covered in plastic wrap. Let it come to room temperature before serving, or warm it in a low oven. It can be kept frozen for up to 2 months: Cover it in plastic wrap, then in foil, and let it come to room temperature before serving."
