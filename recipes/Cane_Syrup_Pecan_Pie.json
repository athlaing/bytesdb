            "one 9-inch pie shell",
            "1/3 cup butter",
            "1/2 teaspoon salt",
            "1 cup pure cane syrup",
            "1 cup brown sugar",
            "3 eggs, beaten",
            "1 teaspoon vanilla extract",
            "2 1/2 tablespoons rum or bourbon",
            "1/2 cup chopped pecans",
            "1 cup pecan halves"

        "instructions": [
            "Preheat the oven to 450\u00b0F. Bake the pie shell for 5 minutes. Set aside. Decrease the oven temperature to 375\u00b0F. In a saucepan over low heat, melt the butter, salt, cane syrup, and brown sugar, stirring together until smooth, about 5 minutes. Transfer to a mixer bowl and allow to cool thoroughly (so the eggs don't cook in the next step). Add the eggs, vanilla, and rum and beat for 10 minutes at medium-high until fluffy smooth. Add the chopped pecans and pulse a few times until well mixed. Pour the filling into the pie shell and arrange the pecan halves over the top. Bake for 50 minutes. Cool on a pie rack until well set before slicing.",
