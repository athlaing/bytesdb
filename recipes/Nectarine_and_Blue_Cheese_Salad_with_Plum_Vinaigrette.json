        "instructions": [
            "Bring plums and 3/4 cup water to a boil in a small saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-high and simmer, stirring occasionally and mashing plums with the back of a spoon, until plums have completely broken down, about 15 minutes. Pour plum mixture through a fine-mesh sieve set over a small bowl, pressing on solids to extract as much pur\u00e9e as possible; discard solids in sieve. Let pur\u00e9e cool. Add oil, vinegar, and 2 tablespoons water to pur\u00e9e; whisk to blend. Season dressing to taste with salt and pepper. DO AHEAD: Dressing can be made 1 week ahead. Cover and chill. Divide greens among plates. Scatter nectarines, cheese, and almonds over, dividing equally, and drizzle some of dressing over. Season with salt and pepper.",
