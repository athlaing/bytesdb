        "ingredients": [
            "2 tablespoons butter, plus more for greasing",
            "10 cups cubed brioche bread (from a 1-pound loaf)",
            "1 cup chopped pecans",
            "4 cups half-and-half",
            "1 cup whole milk",
            "5 eggs, beaten",
            "1 cup packed dark-brown sugar",
            "3 tablespoons bourbon",
            "2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract",
            "1 teaspoon ground cinnamon",
            "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt",
            "1/4 teaspoon grated nutmeg"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Butter a 13 by 9-inch baking dish, and put the cubed brioche in it. Sprinkle with the pecans.",
            "Whisk together the half-and-half, milk, eggs, butter, brown sugar, bourbon, vanilla, cinnamon, salt, and nutmeg in a large bowl.",
            "Pour the custard mixture over the bread in the baking dish, giving the bread a stir to make sure it's coated. Let the pudding sit for 1 hour, so the bread can fully absorb the milk.",
            "Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Once it is ready, put the dish in the oven and bake for 50 minutes, or until puffy and set. Remove, and let stand 10 minutes before serving. This is absolutely lovely when served with some fresh whipped cream."
