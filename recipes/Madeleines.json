        "ingredients": [
            "1 3/4 sticks (14 tablespoons) unsalted butter, melted and cooled, plus additional for brushing molds",
            "1 2/3 cups all-purpose flour",
            "1 tablespoon baking powder",
            "2 teaspoons finely grated fresh lemonzest",
            "1 vanilla bean, halved lengthwise",
            "3/4 cup sugar",
            "3 large eggs",
            "1/4 cup whole milk",
            "1 1/2 tablespoons mild honey",
            "3 nonstick madeleine pans with 12 (2-tablespoon) molds each"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Put racks in upper and lower thirds of oven and preheat oven to 350\u00b0F. Brush molds with melted butter. Sift together flour and baking powder into a large bowl, then whisk in zest. Scrape seeds from vanilla bean into another bowl with tip of a paring knife (reserve pod for another use). Add sugar and rub together until vanilla is well dispersed, then whisk in eggs, milk, honey, and remaining 1 3/4 sticks melted butter. Fold into flour mixture until just combined. Spoon a rounded tablespoon of batter into each mold, filling it about two-thirds full. Bake (with 2 pans on one rack), switching position of pans halfway through baking and rotating 180 degrees, until golden around edges and a wooden pick or skewer inserted into center of a madeleine comes out clean, 10 to 12 minutes total. Turn out madeleines onto a rack and serve slightly warm.",
