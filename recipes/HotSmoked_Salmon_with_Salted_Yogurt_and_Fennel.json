        "ingredients": [
            "1 cup plain whole-milk Greek yogurt",
            "2 Tbsp. fresh lemon juice, divided",
            "Kosher salt",
            "3 Tbsp. whole grain mustard",
            "2 Tbsp. coarsely chopped capers",
            "3 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil, divided, plus more for drizzling",
            "1 large fennel bulb",
            "2 lb. hot-smoked salmon",
            "Freshly ground black pepper"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Mix yogurt and 1 Tbsp. lemon juice in a small bowl; season with salt.",
            "Mix mustard, capers, and 2 Tbsp. oil in another small bowl. Set dressing aside.",
            "Cut fennel stems away from bulb, then cut fronds away from stems; you\u2019ll use each part, but they\u2019re prepped separately. Thinly slice stems crosswise and place in a medium bowl. Coarsely tear fennel fronds until you have about 1 cup and add to bowl. Remove tough outer layers from fennel bulb; discard. Slice bulb in half, then thinly slice crosswise; add to bowl. Add 1 Tbsp. oil and remaining 1 Tbsp. lemon juice, season with salt, and toss to coat.",
            "Divide seasoned yogurt among plates and use a spoon to spread it out. Using your hands, break salmon into big flakes and arrange over yogurt. Spoon mustard dressing over salmon and scatter fennel salad on top. Drizzle with more oil and season with lots of pepper."
