        "title": "Simple Hot Chocolate for One ",
        "ingredients": [
            "1 cup milk or any combination of milk, half-and-half, or cream",
            "Pinch of salt",
            "2 ounces bittersweet (60% cacao) or semisweet chocolate, broken into small pieces or chopped",
            "1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract",
            "1 tablespoon unsweetened cocoa powder (optional)"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Bring the liquid almost to a simmer with the salt over medium heat, then remove it from the heat and add the chocolate. Let it rest for 1 minute, then whisk the mixture until chocolate is melted and liquid is smooth. Stir in vanilla and taste it. If you want a stronger, deeper chocolate flavor, whisk in the cocoa. If necessary, reheat the liquid over medium-low heat, stirring. If you like it frothy, or the cocoa powder didn't blend in smoothly, blend it in the blender. This recipe multiplies easily. When you get up to a quart of milk, use 1/4 teaspoon salt.",
