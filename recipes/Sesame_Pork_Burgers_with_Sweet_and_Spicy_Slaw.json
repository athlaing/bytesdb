            "Make the Burgers: Using your hands or a wooden spoon, mix pork, garlic, Sriracha (if using), sesame oil, fish sauce, 1/4 cup cilantro, and 1/2 tsp. salt in a large bowl until well combined. Shape pork mixture into 4 patties, slightly larger in diameter than English muffins (about 4\"). Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium. Working in batches if necessary, fry patties until browned on both sides and cooked through, 6\u20138 minutes. Spread reserved dressing on muffins. Place a patty on bottom halves. Season with salt and pepper. Pile on some slaw, pickles, and cilantro, then close muffins. Serve with remaining slaw alongside. Do Ahead: Patties can be made 1 day ahead. Separate with parchment if stacking. Cover and chill, or freeze up to 1 month.",
