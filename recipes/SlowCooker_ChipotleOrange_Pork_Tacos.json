Let sit 10 minutes, then spoon off and discard fat. Transfer 1/2 cup juices to a resealable container and chill to use in Chile-Orange Pork Stir-Fry.",
            "Using 2 forks or tongs, shred meat into bite-size pieces, discarding any larger pieces of fat. Transfer 2 cups meat to a resealable container and chill for Chile-Orange Pork Stir-Fry, or reserve for another use. Return remaining meat (you should have about 6 cups) to slow cooker along with 1 cup strained juices. Keep warm until ready to use.",
