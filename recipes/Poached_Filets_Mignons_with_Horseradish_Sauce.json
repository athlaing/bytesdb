            "Season filets with salt and pepper. In a 2-quart saucepan heat demiglace and water just to a simmer and add steak. Add some boiling water to mixture if necessary to make enough liquid to just cover steak. Poach steak at a bare simmer (meat will toughen if liquid is allowed to boil), without turning, 8 minutes and remove from broth. Boil broth over high heat until reduced to about 1/2 cup and stir in mustard and horseradish. Keep sauce warm over low heat and halve steaks horizontally.",
