        "instructions": [
            "Toast chiles in a dry large skillet over medium heat until slightly puffed and lightly darkened on both sides, about 2 minutes. Remove from skillet; let cool. Stem chiles and halve lengthwise; discard seeds. Place in a medium bowl and add boiling water to cover. Let chiles stand until soft, about 20 minutes. Drain.",
            "Combine chiles, garlic, lemon zest and juice, oil, salt, coriander, and cumin in a blender or food processor; pur\u00e9e until marinade is smooth.",
            "Toss short ribs and onion with marinade in a shallow baking dish; cover dish and chill ribs overnight.",
            "Preheat oven to 350\u00b0F. Transfer onion, short ribs, and marinade to a large heavy pot. Add broth. Bring to a boil on stove-top and cover pot. Transfer to oven and braise ribs for 2 hours.",
            "Add potatoes, carrots, and tomato paste (keep meat and vegetables submerged); cover and return to oven. Continue braising until meat is fork-tender and separates easily from the bone and vegetables are soft, 50-60 minutes longer.",
            "Transfer short ribs and vegetables to a large rimmed baking sheet. Cover baking sheet with foil. Strain cooking liquid into a large saucepan. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer, skimming fat from surface occasionally, until sauce is reduced to 4 cups, 8-10 minutes. DO AHEAD: Short ribs, vegetables, and sauce can be made 2 hours ahead. Cover sauce. Let sauce and ribs and vegetables stand at room temperature.",
            "Place covered baking sheet with ribs and vegetables in oven until reheated, about 15 minutes. Stir olives and parsley into sauce and rewarm, stirring occasionally, over medium heat.",
            "Divide short ribs and vegetables among plates and spoon sauce over."
