        "instructions": [
            "Preheat the oven to 400\u00b0F. In a medium bowl, make the marinade by whisking together the mustard, molasses, five-spice powder, and salt. Pat the ribs dry, remove the membrane, and cut the rack in half. Place the ribs in a baking pan and rub with the marinade on both sides. In the Dutch oven, toss the cabbage, apples, green onions, cherries, cider vinegar, ghee, and salt. Place the ribs on top of the vegetables, meaty side up, cover, and cook for 1 hour. Carefully remove the lid so the steam does not burn you, and switch the oven to broil; broil the ribs for another 10 minutes or until they are brown. Remove from the oven and let the ribs rest for 10 minutes before serving. Keeps well in the refrigerator for up to 5 days or in the freezer for up to 3 months.",
