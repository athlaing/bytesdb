            "1/4 cup olive oil",
            "14 oz firm tofu, frozen and then defrosted (Freezing changes texture to a more meaty substance that soaks up flavor. Freeze in plastic wrap, thaw and pat dry with paper towel to remove excess water.)",

            "2 small tomatoes, finely chopped",
            "1/3 cup ground walnuts",
