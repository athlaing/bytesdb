            "Make Fries: Peel potatoes and cut into 1/4-inch-thick sticks. Rinse well, then soak in cold water, chilled, at least 2 hours. Drain potatoes and pat dry thoroughly. Heat 2 1/2 inches canola oil to 275\u00b0F in a 4-to 5-quart heavy pot over medium heat. Fry potatoes in 2 batches, stirring once or twice, 3 minutes per batch (potatoes will not be golden), transferring with a slotted spoon to paper towels to drain. Return oil to 275\u00b0F between batches. Heat oil to 320\u00b0F. Refry potatoes in 2 batches, stirring once or twice, until golden and crisp, about 8 minutes per batch, transferring to fresh paper towels. Return oil to 320\u00b0F between batches. Sprinkle hot fries with kosher salt and vinegar.",
