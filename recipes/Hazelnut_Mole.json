            "Heat oil in large deep nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add garlic to skillet; saut\u00e9 2 minutes. Using slotted spoon, transfer garlic to large bowl. Add hazelnuts to skillet; saut\u00e9 until golden, about 3 minutes. Using slotted spoon, transfer to bowl with garlic. Add plantains and saut\u00e9 until light golden, about 3 minutes. Using slotted spoon, transfer to same bowl. Add apples; saut\u00e9 until beginning to soften, about 5 minutes. Using slotted spoon, transfer to same bowl. Saut\u00e9 onion until golden, about 3 minutes; transfer to same bowl (no oil will remain in skillet). Working in batches, saut\u00e9 a few chiles at a time in same dry skillet, 10 seconds per side; transfer to same bowl. Saut\u00e9 prunes 2 minutes; transfer to same bowl. Add all spices to skillet and stir 30 seconds. Transfer to same bowl.",
            "Using tongs, turn tortillas over gas flame or in dry skillet over medium-high heat until black spots appear on both sides, about 1 minute. Crumble tortillas into same bowl. Add 9 cups broth to bowl; press down on all ingredients to submerge. Let soak 20 minutes.",
            "Working in batches, puree contents of bowl in blender, adding more broth by 1/4 cupfuls if needed, until almost smooth. Transfer to heavy large pot and bring to boil, stirring occasionally. Reduce heat to medium-low; simmer mole 1 hour 45 minutes, stirring often and adding more broth by 1/4 cupfuls as needed to prevent scorching. (Mole will be very thick and will measure about 8 cups.) Stir in vinegar. Season mole generously with salt. (Can be made 4 days ahead. Cover and chill.)",
