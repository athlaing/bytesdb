        "ingredients": [
            "2 cups whole milk",
            "2 eggs (preferably free-range)",
            "2 egg yolks",
            "1/3 cup sugar",
            "1 teaspoon vanilla extract",
            "Freshly grated or ground nutmeg"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "1. Preheat oven to 300\u00b0F.",
            "2. Place six 4-ounce ovenproof cups (you can use ramekins, or coffee cups marked as oven-safe) in a deep baking pan just large enough to hold them.",
            "3. In a medium saucepan, bring the milk to a simmer over medium-low heat.",
            "4. Meanwhile, in a separate bowl, whisk together the eggs, yolks, sugar, and vanilla.",
            "5. Slowly pour the egg mixture into the simmering milk, whisking gently to combine.",
            "6. Pour the mixture through a fine strainer into the cups (if the strainer clogs, use a spoon to scrape it clean), then sprinkle lightly with the nutmeg.",
            "7. Pour hot (not boiling) water into the pan until it reaches halfway up the sides of the cups.",
            "8. Bake until the custard is just set (it can still be a little loose), 30 to 35 minutes.",
            "9. Let the custard cool in the water bath for about 2 hours before serving."
