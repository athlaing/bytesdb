            "1/2 cup tapioca flour",
            "3/4 cup garbanzo bean (chickpea) flour",
            "1 cup potato starch",
            "1 1/4 cups white rice flour",
            "2 1/2 teaspoons dry yeast",
            "2 tablespoons sugar",
            "1 tablespoon ground flax seeds",
            "1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt",
            "3 eggs",
            "1/4 cup plus 1 1/2 teaspoons safflower oil",
            "1 1/2 cups warm water, or more if needed"

        "instructions": [
            "Mix the dry ingredients in a large bowl until well combined. In another bowl, stir the eggs, 1/4 cup of the oil, and the water together. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and mix well by hand. The dough should look like cake batter; if it does not, add more warm water a tablespoon at a time until it does. Move the bowl to a warm place and let it sit for 1 hour.",
            "With the rack in the middle of the oven, turn the heat to 400\u00b0F. Grease a 7 1/2-x-3 1/2-x-3-inch metal loaf pan with the remaining safflower oil. Pour the batter into the greased pan and bake for 50 to 55 minutes, covering the top of the bread lightly with aluminum foil after the first 10 minutes. Turn the loaf out onto a wire rack by carefully running a knife along the edges of the pan and inverting. Allow to cool before slicing."
