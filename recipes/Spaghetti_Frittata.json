            "8 ounces spaghetti, cooked, rinsed, cooled",
            "2 cups tomato-based pasta sauce, divided",
            "5 large eggs",
            "1/2 cup chopped fresh Italian parsley, divided",
            "1/2 teaspoon salt",
            "1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper",
            "1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper",
            "5 tablespoons olive oil",

        "instructions": [
            "Preheat broiler. Toss pasta and 1 cup pasta sauce in medium bowl to blend. Combine eggs, 1/4 cup parsley, salt, black pepper, and cayenne pepper in small bowl; whisk to blend.",
            "Heat oil in large broilerproof nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add pasta and toss until warmed through, about 4 minutes. Pour egg mixture over; do not stir. Reduce heat to medium-low. Cook until eggs start to firm and bottom begins to brown, lifting sides occasionally to let uncooked egg run underneath, about 8 minutes. Remove skillet from heat. Sprinkle frittata with cheese. Broil until cheese melts, about 3 minutes.",
            "Meanwhile, heat remaining 1 cup pasta sauce in saucepan over low heat. Using flexible spatula, loosen edges and bottom of frittata. Slide out onto plate. Sprinkle with remaining 1/4 cup parsley. Cut frittata into wedges. Serve, passing warm sauce separately."
