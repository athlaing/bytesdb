            "On a large baking sheet spread bread in one layer and toast under broiler about 4 inches from heat until pale golden, about 3 minutes on each side. Cool bread. Bread may be toasted 2 days ahead and kept in a sealable bag at room temperature.",
            "In a bowl toss together bread, tomatoes, chopped celery, olives, onion, and capers. In a blender or small food processor blend together vinegar, garlic paste, olive oil, and salt and pepper to taste until smooth and drizzle over salad. Toss salad well and let stand at room temperature while grilling chicken.",

Grill chicken on a rack set 5 to 6 inches over glowing coals 4 to 5 minutes on each side, or until just cooked through. (Alternatively, chicken may be grilled in 2 batches in a hot well-seasoned ridged grill pan over moderately high heat.) Transfer chicken to a cutting board and cool. Stir basil into salad. Slice chicken on the diagonal and serve with salad. Garnish each serving with whole celery leaves.",
