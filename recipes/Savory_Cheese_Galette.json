            "Make the filling: In a food processor blend together the Roquefort, cut into pieces, the cream, the wine, the egg yolk, the flour, and salt and pepper to taste until the filling is smooth. In a bowl combine the flour, the sugar, and the salt, add the butter, and blend the mixture until it resembles coarse meal. Stir in the eggs and on a lightly floured surface knead the dough lightly for several seconds, or until it is combined. Divide the dough in half, form each half into a ball, and chill the dough, wrapped in plastic wrap, for 1 hour. On the lightly floured surface roll out each ball of dough into a 10-inch round. Press 1 of the dough rounds into the bottom and 3/4 inch up the side of a buttered 9-inch round cake pan, spread the filling evenly over the bottom of the dough with a narrow metal spatula, and sprinkle it with the almonds. Using the tip of the spatula, cleaned, fold the edge of the dough over the filling. Arrange the remaining dough round on top of the filling and with the spatula press the edge of the top round between the bottom round and the side of the pan, enclosing the filling and sealing the galette. Score the top in a diamond pattern with a fork, brush the dough with the egg wash, and chill the galette for at least 30 minutes and up to 8 hours. Bake the galette in the middle of a preheated 400\u00b0F. oven for 50 to 55 minutes, or until it is golden brown, and let it cool in the pan on a rack for 10 minutes. Run a thin knife around the edge of the galette, turn the galette out carefully onto a plate, and invert it onto the rack. Let the galette cool completely and serve it, cut into thin wedges, with the grapes.",
