            "For the Huevos Rancheros In a saucepan, reheat the beans over low heat, stirring until heated through. Meanwhile, in a large frying pan, heat 2 tablespoons of the olive oil over medium heat. Add 1 tortilla at a time, heating until each tortilla is lightly crispy around the edges but still soft in the center, about 15 seconds per side. Transfer the tortillas to a plate. To that same pan, add the remaining 1 tablespoon oil, turning the pan to coat the bottom. Once the oil is slightly shimmering, crack the eggs directly into the pan. Cover the pan with a lid and cook until the whites are set on top but the yolks are still runny, 5 to 6 minutes. Sprinkle with a pinch of sea salt.",
