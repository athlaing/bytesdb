            "Preheat the oven to 450\u00b0F. Prepare a baking sheet by lining it with parchment paper or aluminum foil.",
            "Put the corn kernels on the baking sheet and toss with the oil, 1/4 teaspoon salt, and black pepper to taste. Spread the corn out evenly on the baking sheet and roast for 20 minutes, until the corn turns a golden brown. It may seem that you have left the corn in the oven for too long, but you want the corn to caramelize and get a little crunchy. Remove the corn from the oven and set aside.",
            "Prepare the Corn for the Soup Put the kernels (fresh or frozen and defrosted) in a blender. Combine the oil and the garlic in a soup pot over medium heat. Add the onion and jalape\u00f1o. Season with salt and pepper and saut\u00e9 until the vegetables are soft and translucent, about 6 minutes. Transfer the vegetables to the blender and puree until smooth. (You may need to pulse or stir the corn mixture in order to achieve a smooth consistency, but do not add any more liquid.)",
