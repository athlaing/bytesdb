        "ingredients": [
            "2 1/4 cups plus 2 tablespoons (10.6 ounces/300g) all-purpose white flour, plus extra for dusting",
            "2 teaspoons (0.28 ounce/8g) baking powder",
            "A good pinch of salt",
            "1/3 cup (2.6 ounces/75g) unsalted butter, at cool room temperature (neither fridge-cold nor soft), cut into cubes",
            "3 1/2 tablespoons (1.8 ounces/50g) superfine sugar",
            "1 medium free-range egg",
            "1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract",
            "1/2 cup heavy cream",
            "A little milk, for brushing"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Preheat the oven to 400\u00b0F. Using a food processor if you have one, whiz together the flour, baking powder, salt, butter, and sugar until the mixture resembles fine bread crumbs. (Otherwise, sift the flour, salt, and baking powder into a mixing bowl, rub in the butter with your fingers, then stir in the sugar.)",
            "In a separate bowl, beat together the egg, vanilla, and cream, then add to the flour mixture and bring together with your hands to form a soft dough.",
            "Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and knead very briefly, for 10 seconds or so, to make it a little smoother. Now, using a little more flour, pat or gently roll out to a thickness of about 1 1/2 inches.",
            "Using a 2 1/2-inch biscuit cutter (or a larger one, if you like), cut out about 8 disks of dough \u2013 pressing the cutter straight down, rather than twisting it, as this gives the scones a better chance of rising straight up.",
            "Lay the disks on a lightly greased baking sheet, brush the tops with milk, and bake for about 15 minutes, or a little longer if the scones are large. To check that they are cooked, insert a wooden toothpick into the middle; it should come out clean.",
            "Transfer to a wire rack to cool for a few minutes, then serve warm."
