        "title": "Citrus and Avocado Salad with Orange Water ",
        "ingredients": [
            "2 1/2 pounds mixed citrus (such as oranges, blood oranges, and/or grapefruit)",
            "1/2 cup kumquats, thinly sliced, seeds removed (optional)",
            "2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice",
            "2 teaspoons orange-flower or rose water",
            "Large pinch of kosher salt",
            "1 avocado, cut into large pieces",
            "3 tablespoons salted or unsalted, roasted pistachios, finely crushed",
            "3 tablespoons tarragon leaves",
            "Extra-virgin olive oil (for drizzling)"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Using a paring knife, remove peel and white pith from citrus, being careful not to remove too much of the flesh. Slice citrus into 1/2\"-thick rounds, then cut into 1 1/2\" pieces (it looks cool and is less fussy if pieces aren\u2019t too exact in shape and size). Transfer to a medium bowl and add kumquats, if using, lemon juice, orange-flower water, and salt. Toss and let sit 5 minutes so citrus can release some of their juices.",
            "Transfer citrus, leaving juice behind, to a large plate. Tuck avocado in between and around citrus.",
            "Spoon citrus juice over salad, scatter pistachios and tarragon over, and drizzle with oil."
