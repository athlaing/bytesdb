        "ingredients": [
            "9 medium navel oranges",
            "1/2 cup sugar",
            "1/2 cup water",
            "1 tablespoon unsalted butter"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Squeeze enough juice from 3 oranges to measure 1 cup.",
            "Bring sugar and water to a boil in a 1 1/2-quart heavy saucepan over moderate heat, stirring until sugar is dissolved. Boil syrup, without stirring but washing down any sugar crystals with a pastry brush dipped in cold water, until syrup around edges begins to turn golden brown, about 10 minutes. Tilt pan and carefully add orange juice (caramel will harden and vigorously steam). Simmer, stirring, until caramel is completely dissolved, about 2 minutes.",
            "Cut peel, including all white pith, from remaining 6 oranges with a sharp paring knife and cut each orange crosswise into thirds.",
            "Heat one third of butter (1 teaspoon) in a 12-inch nonstick skillet over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking, then saut\u00e9 6 orange slices until golden, 2 to 3 minutes on each side. Transfer to a plate. Saut\u00e9 remaining orange slices in butter in same manner, wiping out skillet between batches if necessary. Return all orange slices to skillet along with caramel sauce and cook over moderate heat until heated through, about 1 minute."
