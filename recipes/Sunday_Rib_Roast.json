            "1 (2-rib) tied prime beef rib roast (from small end; about 4 1/2 lb trimmed)",
            "1 1/2 tablespoons kosher salt",
            "1 teaspoon black pepper",
            "2 tablespoons all-purpose flour",
            "1 1/2 tablespoons English dry mustard (preferably Colman's)",

        "instructions": [
            "Put oven rack in lower third of oven and preheat oven to 450\u00b0F.",
            "Put beef, fat side up, in a small roasting pan and sprinkle all over with salt and pepper. Stir together flour and dry mustard, then pat onto top and sides of roast to form a thick coating.",
            "Roast beef 20 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 350\u00b0F and roast until thermometer inserted into center of meat registers 115\u00b0F, about 1 1/4 hours more.
