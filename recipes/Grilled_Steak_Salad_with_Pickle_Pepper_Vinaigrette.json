Discard tough stems from watercress. Season steak with salt and pepper and grill on an oiled rack set 5 to 6 inches over glowing coals about 3 minutes on each side for medium-rare.

Holding a sharp knife at a 45\u00b0 angle, cut steak into about 12 thin slices. Spoon vinaigrette generously onto 2 large plates and mound watercress in center. Arrange steak slices on watercress.",
