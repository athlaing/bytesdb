        "instructions": [
            "Place a rack in middle of oven and preheat to 350\u00b0F. Butter and flour a 13x9\" baking pan. Whisk baking powder, salt, and 2 cups flour in a medium bowl. Finely grate lemon zest into another medium bowl. Slice lemon in half; set aside. Add 1 2/3 cups granulated sugar to zest and work with your fingers until mixture is fragrant and looks like wet sand, about 1 minute. Using an electric mixer on medium speed, beat 1 cup butter in a large bowl until smooth, about 20 seconds. Add sugar mixture, increase speed to medium-high, and beat until very light and fluffy, about 5 minutes. Reduce speed to medium and add eggs one at a time, beating well between additions; mix in egg yolk. Reduce speed to low and gradually add dry ingredients. Beat just until incorporated, then add brandy and beat just until smooth. Fold batter a few times with a rubber spatula; scrape into prepared pan and smooth top. Scatter fruit over (do not press down). Squeeze a reserved lemon half over fruit (save other half for another use) and sprinkle with remaining 3 Tbsp. granulated sugar. Bake cake until sides are golden brown and top is golden, 55\u201365 minutes. Let cool; cut into squares. Serve dusted with powdered sugar.",
