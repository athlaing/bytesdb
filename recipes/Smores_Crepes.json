            "In a blender, combine all cr\u00eape ingredients and pur\u00e9e on low speed until smooth (scrape down sides of blender, if necessary, and blend again until smooth; do not overblend). Transfer to an airtight container and refrigerate, covered, at least 1 hour.",
            "Make chocolate filling while batter is chilling: In a small heavy saucepan over medium-low heat, melt chocolate and cream, stirring, until smooth. Transfer to a small bowl and set aside.",

            "Make marshmallow filling while batter is chilling: In a bowl, whisk together marshmallow spread and water (start with 1 teaspoon water) until it is easily spreadable. Keep covered at room temperature.",

            "Cook cr\u00eapes: Whisk batter. Brush skillet lightly with additional melted butter and heat over medium heat until hot. Fill a 1/4-cup measure three-quarters full with batter, then lift skillet from heat and pour in batter, tilting and rotating skillet to coat bottom in a thin, even layer. (If batter sets before skillet is coated, reduce heat slightly. Next cr\u00eape will be better. If batter is too thick to make a thin cr\u00eaepe, stir in 1 to 2 tablespoons of water.) Cook cr\u00eape until golden around edges and dry in center, about 45 seconds. Loosen cr\u00eape from skillet with a heat-proof plastic spatula; with fingertips or spatula, flip cr\u00eape over. Cook until underside is golden, about 15 seconds, then slide cr\u00eape onto a kitchen towel and fold towel over it. Make more cr\u00eapes, brushing pan with additional melted butter occasionally (it's not necessary to brush every time) and stacking them on top of each other in the towel. (You should have about 12 to 14 cr\u00eapes.)",

Top with 1 tablespoon marshmallow and spread it evenly. Fold cr\u00eape in half, then fold into thirds to form a wedge shape. Fill and fold remaining cr\u00eapes and arrange on a buttered, large, rimmed sheet pan. Brush cr\u00eapes lightly with melted butter, then sift confectioners' sugar over them.
