            "In a 12-inch cast iron or other oven-safe skillet over medium-high heat, heat butter. Add the chopped vegetable mixture, season with a generous pinch of salt and pepper, and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender, 7 to 8 minutes. Reduce heat to medium, add the bread cubes and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, 5 to 7 minutes.",
