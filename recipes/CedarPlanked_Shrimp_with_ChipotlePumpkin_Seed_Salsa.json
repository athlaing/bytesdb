            "More info: Look for cedar planks at cookware stores or order them online from fireandflavor.com or natures-cuisine.com. Look for planks that are about 3/4 inch thick (thinner ones can burn and warp on the grill). Be sure to buy natural planks, which are sometimes labeled \"untreated.\" Avoid cedar shingles, as they may be treated with chemicals. When soaking planks, weigh them down so they're covered by the water.",
