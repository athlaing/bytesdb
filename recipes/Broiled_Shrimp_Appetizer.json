            "20 large shrimp",
            "1 cup olive oil",
            "juice of 3 lemons",
            "1/4 cup soy sauce",
            "1/4 cup finely chopped parsley",
            "3 tablespoons of fresh or dried tarragon"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "With sharp scissors cut down the back of each shrimp shell and remove the black vein but do not remove the shell. Wash the shrimp thoroughly and place them in a large bowl. Over them pour olive oil, the lemon juice, soy sauce, parsley and tarragon. Let the shrimp stand in this mixture for 2 hours, tossing them around now and then so that they will be equally marinated.",
            "When you are ready to cook them, arrange them in basket grills and cook over hot coals for 5 to 6 minutes, turning twice. They should be tender and moist with lightly charred shells. Have finger bowls and pass plenty of paper napkins."
