            "14 ounces Yukon Gold potatoes, peeled, cut into 1-inch pieces",

        "instructions": [
            "Butter six 3/4-cup ramekins. Bring milk and bay leaf to simmer in small saucepan. Remove from heat. Cover; let steep 15 minutes. Discard bay leaf.",
            "Meanwhile, cook potatoes in medium saucepan of boiling salted water until very tender, about 15 minutes. Drain. Place potatoes in medium bowl. Add warm milk, shallots, butter, rosemary, and thyme; mash until smooth. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Divide potato mixture among ramekins. (Can be prepared 1 day ahead. Cover and chill. Bring to room temperature before continuing.)",
            "Preheat oven to 350\u00b0F. Carefully crack 1 egg over potatoes in each ramekin. Spoon 1 tablespoon cream over each egg. Sprinkle each with 1 tablespoon Parmesan. Place ramekins in 13x9x2-inch metal baking pan. Pour enough hot water into baking pan to come halfway up sides of ramekins. Bake until egg whites are gently set but yolks are still soft, about 17 minutes. Remove ramekins from baking pan. Sprinkle chives over and serve."
