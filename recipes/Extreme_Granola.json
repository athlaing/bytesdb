            "3/4 cups pecans",
            "1/2 cup natural almonds",
            "4 cups old-fashioned rolled oats",
            "1/4 cup sesame seeds (optional)",
            "1 stick (8 tablespoons) unsalted butter",
            "1/3 cup pure maple syrup, cane syrup or honey, at room temperature",
            "1/4 teaspoon fine salt",
            "3/4 cup chopped dates",

        "instructions": [
            "Preheat the oven to 375\u00b0F. Line a large shallow baking sheet with foil. Spread the pecans and almonds on the sheet and roast for 8 to 10 minutes, until lightly toasted. Transfer the nuts to a board, let cool and chop the nuts. Set aside.",
            "Reduce the oven temperature to 300\u00b0F. Pour the oats and sesame seeds, if using, in a mound on the same baking sheet. Melt the butter in a small bowl in the microwave; stir in the maple syrup and salt and drizzle on top of the oats. Stir well with a rubber spatula and then spread out the oats in an even layer.",
            "Bake the oats for 30 minutes, stirring once with the spatula halfway through, until the oats are lightly colored. Let cool; the mixture will crisp as it cools. Add the dates, blueberries, and reserved nuts and toss."
