            "2 1-pound loaves frozen white bread dough, thawed, room temperature",
            "9 tablespoons olive oil",
            "1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper",
            "2 medium onions, chopped",
            "5 large garlic cloves, minced",
            "2 large red bell peppers, chopped",
            "1 large bunch green Swiss chard, ribs removed and thinly sliced, leaves thinly sliced"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Place each loaf of bread dough in separate bowl. Add 1 tablespoon oil to each; season each with 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Knead each in bowl until oil is well incorporated, about 3 minutes. Let dough rest in bowls 10 minutes.",
            "Oil two 15x10-inch baking sheets. Turn out dough onto floured surface; knead 1 minute. Roll out each dough piece to irregular 13x9-inch rectangle, pulling and stretching dough. Transfer each to prepared sheet. Brush each with 1 tablespoon oil. Let dough rise uncovered in warm draft-free area until puffy, about 30 minutes.",
            "Meanwhile, preheat oven to 400\u00b0F. Heat 3 tablespoons oil in heavy large skillet over medium heat. Add onions and garlic; saut\u00e9 1 minute. Add bell peppers and chard ribs and saut\u00e9 until tender, about 10 minutes. Add chard leaves and stir until just wilted and coated with oil, about 3 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.",
            "Press dough all over with fingers, forming indentations. Brush each with 1 tablespoon of oil. Spread vegetables over, leaving 1-inch border. Bake until crusts are golden, about 25 minutes. Serve at room temperature."
