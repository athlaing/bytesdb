        "ingredients": [
            "3 cups all-purpose flour",
            "1/4 teaspoon salt",
            "1 stick (1/2 cup) cold unsalted butter",
            "2/3 cup cold vegetable shortening",
            "1/3 cup boiling water"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "In a large bowl stir together flour and salt and make a well in center. Cut butter and shortening into bits and put into well. Pour boiling water over fats in bowl, stirring fats and water with a fork until water is incorporated (some of fat will still be in lumps). With fork incorporate surrounding flour until fat is evenly distributed. On a floured surface divide dough into 4 portions. With heel of hand smear each portion once in a forward motion to help distribute fat. Form dough into 2 pieces, one slightly larger than the other, and flatten into disks. Chill disks, wrapped in plastic wrap, until firm, about 1 hour. Dough may be made 1 day ahead and chilled or 2 weeks ahead and frozen, wrapped well. Let dough soften slightly before rolling out."
