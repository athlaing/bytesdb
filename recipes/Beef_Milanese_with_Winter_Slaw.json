            "Whisk lemon juice and honey in a medium bowl. Add cabbage, carrot, onion, and dill; toss to coat. Season with salt and pepper. Season beef with salt and pepper. Place flour in a shallow dish. Place eggs in another dish and breadcrumbs in a third dish. Pour oil into a large heavy deep skillet to a depth of 1/4\". Heat over medium-high heat.
