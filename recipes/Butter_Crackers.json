            "1/3 cup (45 grams) white spelt or all-purpose flour",
            "2/3 cup (90 grams) white whole-wheat flour",
            "1/4 cup (30 grams) oat or cake flour",
            "1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder",
            "1 1/2 tablespoons cane sugar",
            "1/2 teaspoon salt",
            "3 tablespoons unsalted butter, chilled and cut into pieces",
            "1 tablespoon flaxseed or olive oil",
            "1/4 cup (2 ounces) ice water, divided",
            "1 egg",
            "1 tablespoon milk",
            "2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted",

        "instructions": [
            "Preheat the oven to 400\u00b0F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment and set aside. Sift the white spelt flour, white whole-wheat flour, oat flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt together. Pour into the bowl of a food processor fitted with the dough blade (or in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment). Add the chilled butter and pulse to create a coarse crumb mixture. With the food processor running, stream in the flaxseed oil, followed by the water, 1 tablespoon at a time, until the mixture starts to form large clumps. Turn the dough out onto a well-floured surface and gather it into a ball. Knead gently once or twice. Sprinkle a little more flour on top of the dough and roll it out until it is 1/4 inch thick, rotating the dough by 90 degrees after each roll. Prick the dough all over with a fork, making sure it is well pierced. Using a small cookie cutter of your choice, cut out the crackers and carefully place them on the prepared baking sheets. In a small bowl, lightly whisk the egg with the milk. Using a pastry brush, coat the tops of the crackers with the egg wash. Bake just until the crackers begin to brown, 5 to 10 minutes. While the crackers are baking, stir the melted butter and salt together in a small bowl. Brush the mixture onto the freshly baked, still warm crackers before serving.",
