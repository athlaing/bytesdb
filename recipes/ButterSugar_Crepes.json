Blend milk, flour, eggs, 2 tablespoons sugar, 2 tablespoons butter, and 1/4 teaspoon salt in a blender until smooth, then chill, covered, 30 minutes. Lightly brush a 10-inch nonstick skillet with some of reserved butter and heat over medium heat until hot. Pour in 1/4 cup batter, immediately tilting and rotating skillet to coat bottom, and cook cr\u00eape, turning once, until just set and golden, about 1 minute total. Transfer to a plate. Make 7 more cr\u00eapes, stacking them. Brush each cr\u00eape with 1 teaspoon butter and sprinkle with 1 teaspoon sugar, then fold twice to form a triangle. Heat 2 teaspoons each of butter and sugar with a pinch of salt in skillet until sugar has dissolved, then cook 4 cr\u00eapes, turning once, until golden brown. Repeat with remaining butter, sugar, and cr\u00eapes.",
