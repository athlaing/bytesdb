Add chopped onion to skillet and saut\u00e9 until soft, about 4 minutes. Add white parts of green onions, garlic, and ginger; saut\u00e9 until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Add chicken broth mixture, stirring to scrape up any browned bits. Add star anise and orange peel; bring to simmer.",
            "Return ribs to same skillet. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer 30 minutes. Add carrots and turnips to skillet, pushing to submerge in sauce. Cover and simmer until vegetables and ribs are tender, gently stirring mixture occasionally, about 30 minutes longer. Transfer mixture to platter. Serve with steamed rice."
