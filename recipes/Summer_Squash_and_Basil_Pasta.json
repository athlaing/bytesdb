            "Heat oil in a large skillet over medium. Cook garlic, stirring occasionally, until very lightly browned around the edges, about 4 minutes. Add squash; season with salt. Cook, tossing occasionally, until squash begins to break down and gets jammy (they may start to stick to the skillet a bit, which means you are there!), 12\u201315 minutes. Toss in 1 tsp. Aleppo-style pepper.",
            "Meanwhile, cook pasta in a large pot of boiling salted water, stirring occasionally, until very al dente.",
            "Transfer pasta to skillet using a slotted spoon or spider and add 1/2 cup pasta cooking liquid. Cook pasta, adding 2 oz. Parmesan in stages along with more pasta cooking liquid as needed, until sauce coats pasta and pasta is al dente. Toss in lemon juice and most of the basil.",
            "Divide pasta among bowls and top with more Parmesan and Aleppo-style pepper and remaining basil."
