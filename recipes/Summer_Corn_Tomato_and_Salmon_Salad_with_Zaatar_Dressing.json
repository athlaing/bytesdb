        "instructions": [
            "Generously salt a large pot of water (it should taste like the ocean). Thinly slice half of 1 lemon and add to water along with garlic, thyme, and bay leaves. Bring to a boil, then let boil at least 3 minutes and up to 10 to infuse water.",
            "Meanwhile, whisk oil, 3 Tbsp. lemon juice, 4 tsp. za\u2019atar, and 1 tsp. salt in a small bowl.",
            "Add corn to boiling water and cook until bright yellow and tender, about 6 minutes. Transfer to a plate.",
            "Reduce heat to low, gently add salmon, and poach just until cooked through, about 5 minutes. Transfer to a cutting board with a slotted spoon or spatula and flake into chunks.",
            "Meanwhile, slice corn off cob into a large bowl. Add tomatoes and onion, then toss with 1/2 cup dressing.",
            "Add flaked salmon to corn mixture and toss very gently just to coat with dressing. Transfer to a serving platter or divide among plates. Top with arugula, then drizzle with remaining dressing. Serve with additional za\u2019atar alongside."
