        "instructions": [
            "If using a charcoal grill, open vents on bottom of grill, then light charcoal. Charcoal fire is medium-hot when you can hold your hand 5 inches above rack for 3 to 4 seconds. If using a gas grill, preheat burners on high, covered, 10 minutes, then reduce heat to moderate.",
            "Stir together onion, parsley, tomato, oregano, Urfa and Maras peppers, 2 tablespoons oil, and 1/4 teaspoon salt.",
            "Pat lamb dry, then toss with black pepper, 1 tablespoon oil, and remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt and thread 4 lamb cubes onto each skewer, leaving a little space in between cubes. Brush lavash (on both sides) with remaining 3 tablespoons oil and transfer to a platter.",
            "Grill lamb, covered only if using a gas grill, on lightly oiled grill rack, turning over once, until medium-rare, 6 to 8 minutes total. Transfer lamb skewers to a platter and cover with foil to keep warm.",
            "Grill lavash, covered only if using a gas grill, turning over once, until just heated through and lightly browned but still flexible, about 45 seconds total.",
            "Remove lamb from skewers and divide among pieces of lavash. Top lamb with tomato mixture and roll up lavash to enclose lamb. Serve immediately."
