            "2 tablespoons fresh lime juice",
            "5 garlic cloves",
            "2 teaspoons ground cumin",
            "1 teaspoon paprika",
            "1/2 teaspoon dried oregano",

            "Put chicken in a large sealable bag and add marinade. Seal bag and marinate, chilled, 8 to 24 hours.",
            "Grill chicken: If using a charcoal grill, open vents on bottom and lid of grill. Light a large chimney starter full of charcoal (preferably hardwood). When coals are lit, dump them out along opposite sides of bottom rack, leaving a space free of coals (the size of the quartered chicken) in middle. When you can hold your hand 5 inches above the grill rack directly over coals for 3 to 4 seconds, coals will be medium-hot. If using a gas grill, preheat all burners on high, then reduce heat to medium-high. Discard marinade, then pat chicken dry. Oil grill rack, then grill chicken over area with no coals (or over a turned-off burner), skin side down first, covered, turning over once, until cooked through, 30 to 35 minutes (add charcoal to maintain heat).",
