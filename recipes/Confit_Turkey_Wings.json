Press out air, seal bag, and rub outside of bag until spices are evenly distributed. Chill 24\u201336 hours. Preheat oven to 200\u00b0F. Remove turkey pieces from bag, rinse under water, and pat dry; discard spices and herbs. Place turkey in loaf pan. Pour in ghee, then add oil (pieces should be completely covered). Roast turkey until an instant-read thermometer inserted into drumette registers 190\u00b0F, 3 1/2\u20134 hours. Let cool completely in pan, then chill overnight. Remove turkey pieces from pan, letting any excess oil and ghee drip off, and transfer to a plate. Heat a large skillet over medium-high until hot but not smoking. Cook turkey pieces until browned on all sides and warmed through, 8\u201310 minutes. Serve warm.",
