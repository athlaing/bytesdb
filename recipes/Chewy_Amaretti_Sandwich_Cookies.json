        "ingredients": [
            "1 (7-ounce) tube pure almond paste (not marzipan; 3/4 cup)",
            "1 cup sugar",
            "2 large egg whites at room temperature for 30 minutes",
            "a pastry bag with a 3/8-inch plain tip"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Preheat oven to 300\u00b0F with racks in upper and lower thirds. Line 2 large (17- by 12-inch) 4-sided sheet pans with parchment paper. Pulse almond paste and sugar in a food processor until broken up, then add egg whites and pulse until smooth. Transfer to pastry bag and pipe 3/4-inch rounds (1/3 inch high) about 3/4 inch apart in pans. Dip a fingertip in water and gently tamp down any peaks. Bake, rotating and switching position of pans halfway through, until golden and puffed, 15 to 18 minutes. Wearing an oven mitt, rest 1 pan in sink at an angle. Lift top edge of parchment and slowly pour about 1/4 cup water between parchment and sheet pan so that all of parchment is lightly moistened (water will steam on pan, moistening bottom of cookies to help them stick together later). Repeat with remaining sheet pan. Cool cookies in pans on racks. Peel cookies from parchment and sandwich bottoms of cookies together",
