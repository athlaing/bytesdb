            "1 garlic clove",
            "1 teaspoon cumin seeds",
            "1/2 teaspoon coriander seeds",
            "1/2 teaspoon caraway seeds",
            "1 cup drained bottled roasted red peppers (from a 7-oz jar), rinsed well, patted dry, and finely chopped",
            "2 tablespoons olive oil",
            "3/4 to 1 teaspoon dried hot red-pepper flakes",
            "1/2 teaspoon sugar",
            "3/4 teaspoon salt",
            "2 lb (3/4- to 1-inch-thick) boneless rib-eye steaks",

        "instructions": [
            "Mince garlic and mash to a paste with a pinch of salt using a large heavy knife, then transfer to a bowl. Heat a dry small heavy skillet over moderately low heat until hot, then toast cumin, coriander, and caraway seeds, shaking skillet frequently, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Transfer seeds to grinder and pulse until coarsely ground. Add spices to garlic paste along with roasted peppers, olive oil, red-pepper flakes (to taste), sugar, and 1/4 teaspoon salt. Pat steaks dry and sprinkle all over with pepper and remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt. Prepare grill for cooking with medium-hot charcoal (moderately high heat for gas). Grill steaks on lightly oiled grill rack, turning over once and moving around rack to avoid flare-ups, 5 to 6 minutes for medium-rare. If using a gas grill, cook covered, turning over once and moving around rack to avoid flare-ups, 4 to 5 minutes for medium-rare. Transfer steaks to a cutting board and let stand, uncovered, 5 minutes.",
