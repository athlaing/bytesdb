            "1 cup confectioners' sugar",
            "1 tablespoon salt",
            "a 1-pound jar vacuum-packed whole chestnuts (not canned)",
            "about 4 cups vegetable oil for deep-frying"

        "instructions": [
            "Preheat oven to 325\u00b0 F. Into a large bowl sift together confectioners' sugar and salt. In a shallow baking pan arrange chestnuts in one layer and bake in upper third of oven 6 to 8 minutes, or until hot and outsides are dry. Add hot chestnuts to sugar mixture, tossing gently to coat, and put a rack over baking pan. In a 3-quart saucepan heat 1 1/2 inches oil over moderate heat until a deep-fat thermometer registers 350\u00b0 F. Working in batches of 8, fry chestnuts 1 to 2 minutes, or until brown and crisp. With a slotted spoon transfer chestnuts as fried to rack. Return oil to 350\u00b0 F. between batches and carefully skim caramelized sugar from surface of oil as necessary. Chestnuts are best served immediately but may be made 1 hour ahead and kept, uncovered, at room temperature.",
