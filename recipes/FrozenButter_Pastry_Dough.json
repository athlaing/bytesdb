        "ingredients": [
            "2 2/3 cups cake flour (not self-rising)",
            "4 1/2 tablespoons sugar",
            "3/4 teaspoon salt",
            "2 1/4 sticks (1 cup plus 2 tablespoons) unsalted butter, frozen",
            "9 to 12 tablespoons ice water"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Sift together flour, sugar, and salt into a chilled large metal bowl. Set a grater in flour mixture and coarsely grate in frozen butter, gently lifting flour and tossing to coat butter.",
            "Drizzle 9 tablespoons ice water evenly over flour mixture and gently stir with a fork until incorporated.",
            "Test mixture by gently squeezing a small handful: When it has proper texture, it should hold together without crumbling apart. If necessary, add more ice water, 1 tablespoon at a time, stirring until just incorporated and testing again. (If you overwork mixture or add too much water, pastry will be tough.)",
            "Turn out onto a lightly floured surface and with floured heel of your hand smear dough twice with a forward motion to help distribute fat.",
            "Gather mixture together to form a dough. (Dough will not be smooth.) Form one third of dough into a disk, then form remaining dough into a larger disk.",
            "Chill dough, disks wrapped separately in plastic wrap, 1 hour."
