            "Bring cream, milk, 1/2 cup brown sugar, and nutmeg to a simmer in a heavy medium saucepan over medium heat, stirring. Meanwhile, whisk together eggs, remaining 1/4 cup brown sugar, and 1/8 teaspoon salt in a large bowl. Add cream mixture in a slow stream, whisking. Return to saucepan and cook, stirring with a wooden spoon, until mixture coats back of spoon and registers 175\u00b0F on an instant-read thermometer (do not boil). Immediately strain custard through a fine-mesh sieve into a metal bowl. Stir in rum and chill custard at least 6 hours. Freeze in ice cream maker, then transfer to an airtight container and put in freezer to harden, about 2 hours.",
