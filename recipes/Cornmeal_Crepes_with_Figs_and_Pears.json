        "instructions": [
            "Preheat oven to 350\u00b0F. Spread pistachios on a small rimmed baking sheet; toast, tossing occasionally, until fragrant, 6-8 minutes. Let cool, then coarsely chop; set aside.",
            "Meanwhile, whisk egg, milk, flour, cornmeal, sugar, vanilla, salt, and 1/4 cup cream in a medium bowl until smooth.",
            "Heat a 10\" nonstick skillet over medium heat. Lightly coat skillet with butter and add 3 tablespoons batter, swirling to cover the bottom of skillet. Cook, undisturbed, until edges turn golden and center begins to puff, about 2 minutes. Using a heatproof rubber spatula, loosen edges and then, using your fingers, flip crepe and cook until bottom is dry and set, about 30 seconds longer. Transfer to a plate. Repeat with remaining batter, coating skillet with butter between crepes.",
            "Beat remaining 1 cup cream to soft peaks. Serve crepes folded, topped with whipped cream, pears, figs, and pistachios and drizzled with honey."
