            "Season lamb with 1 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper. Heat olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Working in batches, cook lamb until golden brown on all sides, 7-8 minutes per batch. Using a slotted spoon, transfer browned lamb to a medium bowl and set aside. Add onions to same pot and cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until slightly softened and light golden, about 5 minutes. Add garlic and cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant and beginning to brown, about 1 minute. Add wine and reserved browned lamb along with any accumulated juices. Simmer lamb until liquid is reduced by half, about 5 minutes. Stir in tomato juice, chicken broth, ground cumin, hot paprika, and 1/2 cup water; bring to a boil. Cover, reduce heat to medium, and simmer, stirring occasionally, until lamb is tender and sauce is thickened, about 1 hour 30 minutes. Add chopped carrot and cook uncovered, stirring occasionally, until carrot is tender and sauce is thickened, about 15 minutes. Stir in parsley. Transfer braised lamb to a large bowl. Garnish lamb with peas, almonds, and mint.",
