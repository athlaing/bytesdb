        "title": "Grilled Cheese with Onion Jam, Taleggio, and Escarole ",
        "ingredients": [
            "4 (1/2-inch-thick) center slices sourdough bread (from a 9- to 10-inch round)",
            "4 teaspoons extra-virgin olive oil",
            "1 1/2 tablespoons onion or fig jam",
            "12 to 14 ounces chilled Taleggio or Italian Fontina, sliced",
            "1/4 pound escarole, center ribs discarded and leaves cut crosswise into 1-inch pieces (about 2 cups)"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Brush 1 side of bread slices with oil and arrange, oil sides down, on a work surface. Spread jam on 2 slices of bread and divide cheese between remaining 2 slices. Mound escarole on top of cheese and season with salt and pepper, then assemble sandwiches.",
            "Heat a dry 12-inch heavy skillet (not nonstick) over medium-low heat until hot. Cook sandwiches, turning once and pressing with a spatula to compact, until bread is golden-brown and cheese is melted, 6 to 8 minutes total."
