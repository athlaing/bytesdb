        "title": "Grilled Corn on the Cob with Salt-and-Pepper Butter ",
        "ingredients": [
            "1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, room temperature",
            "1 tsp. kosher salt",
            "1 tsp. freshly ground black pepper",
            "6 ears of corn"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Prepare a grill for medium-high heat. Mix butter, salt, and pepper in a small bowl; set aside.",
            "Pull back husk from each ear of corn without removing it entirely. Remove silk, then pull husk back into place. (This allows coverage from the grill, both protecting the corn from direct exposure to the flames and partially steaming the ear, while still allowing smoke to penetrate the husk and some charring to occur.) Grill, turning occasionally, until slightly charred and cooked through, about 10 minutes. Transfer corn to a large platter, pull back husks, and spread with reserved butter.",
            "Do Ahead: Butter can be made 1 day ahead. Cover and chill. Bring to room temperature before spreading over corn."
