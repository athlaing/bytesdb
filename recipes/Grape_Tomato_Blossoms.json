        "title": "Grape Tomato \"Blossoms\" ",
        "ingredients": [
            "1/3 cup peppered Boursin cheese (from a 5.2-oz package), softened",
            "1/4 cup finely chopped fresh basil",
            "18 very thin slices Genoa salami (3 1/2 inches in diameter; 1/4 lb)",
            "18 grape tomatoes",
            "18 long fresh chives"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Stir together cheese and basil until combined well. Put 1/2 teaspoon cheese in center of 1 salami round. Press 1 tomato, stemmed end down, into cheese (to stabilize it), then gather salami up around tomato. Turn wrapped tomato on its side and tie salami with a chive just below gathers (handle chive gently so it won't break), leaving top of tomato exposed. Make more \"blossoms\" in same manner, then trim chives."
