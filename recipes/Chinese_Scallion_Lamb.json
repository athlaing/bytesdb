            "Slice lean lamb thinly across the grain, discarding all gristle. Toss with soy sauce and allow to stand 10 minutes. Cut scallions diagonally into 1/4\" sections. Heat lard or oil until very hot. Add lamb and ch'ao a minute. Add scallion and stir until wilted. Do not overcook. This dish should not have much free sauce. If it does, the heat was not high enough."
