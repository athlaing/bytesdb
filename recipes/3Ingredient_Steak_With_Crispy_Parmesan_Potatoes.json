            "Place potatoes in a medium pot; add cold water to cover by 1\". Season with salt, bring to a boil, and cook until potatoes are fork-tender, 12\u201315 minutes. Transfer to a rimmed baking sheet; let cool slightly, then lightly crush with your palm.",

Add 3 Tbsp. oil, 3/4 tsp. salt, and remaining potatoes to pan; cook, turning once, until golden brown, 15\u201320 minutes. Return all potatoes to pan, sprinkle with cheese, and cook, tossing to coat, until cheese begins to crisp, 1\u20132 more minutes.",
            "Meanwhile, heat remaining 2 Tbsp. oil in a large skillet over medium-high. Season steak with salt and pepper and cook, turning occasionally, until deep brown and an instant-read thermometer registers 125\u00b0F for medium-rare, about 3 minutes per side.",
            "Transfer steak to a cutting board. Thinly slice steak against the grain and serve with potatoes alongside."
