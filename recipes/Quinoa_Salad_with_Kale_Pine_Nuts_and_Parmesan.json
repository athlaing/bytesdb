            "1 small onion, minced",
            "2 cups white quinoa, rinsed",
            "1 1/2 cups water",
            "3 cups chopped kale (about 12 ounces)",
            "1/3 cup red wine vinegar",
            "1 teaspoon Dijon mustard",
            "1/2 cup toasted pine nuts",

        ],
        "instructions": [
            "1. In a medium saucepan, heat 1 tablespoon olive oil over medium heat. Add the onion and saut\u00e9, stirring frequently, until translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the quinoa and saut\u00e9, stirring, until lightly toasted, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the water and kale, stirring to combine. Bring to a simmer, then reduce the heat to low and simmer, covered, until the quinoa is tender and the water has been absorbed, 15 to 18 minutes. Transfer the mixture to a large bowl and let cool. Stir occasionally to bring the warmer part of the mixture up from the bottom.",
            "2. In a small bowl, whisk together the vinegar and mustard until smooth. Add a pinch each of salt and pepper. Slowly add the remaining 3 tablespoons olive oil, whisking continuously to emulsify the dressing.",
            "3. Drizzle the dressing over the cooled quinoa mixture. Stir in the pine nuts and Parmesan cheese and season to taste with additional salt and pepper. Cover and chill completely, 2 to 3 hours. Stir just before serving to fluff the salad and break up any clumps."
