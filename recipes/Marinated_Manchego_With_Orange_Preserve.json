            "Heat oven to 350\u00b0F. Cut 1/4\" off top of garlic bulb and place on a sheet of foil. Drizzle with oil; season with salt. Wrap tightly in foil and bake until skin is golden brown and cloves are tender, 35\u201340 minutes. Let cool. Squeeze cloves into a large bowl. Meanwhile, cut 1/4\" off top and bottom of orange and cut lengthwise into quarters. Remove flesh from each quarter, not including white pith, from peel in 1 piece (save peels). Squeeze juice from flesh into a small bowl; set aside. Cut peel into 1/4\" pieces and place in a small saucepan; pour in cold water to cover by 1\". Bring to a boil then drain; repeat process twice more to remove bitterness. Return orange peels to saucepan and add sugar, reserved orange juice, and 1/2 cup water. Bring to a boil; reduce heat and simmer, stirring occasionally, until peels are soft and liquid is syrupy, 20\u201330 minutes. Let orange preserve cool. Add orange preserve, Manchego, rosemary, thyme, and remaining 1 1/2 cups oil to bowl with garlic and gently toss to combine. Cover and chill at least 12 hours. Bring marinated Manchego to room temperature before serving with bread.",
