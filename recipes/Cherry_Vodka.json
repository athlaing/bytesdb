        "title": "Cherry Vodka ",
        "ingredients": [
            "1 1/8 lb/510 g fresh sour cherries (or black currants or jagody)",
            "25 oz/750 ml clear vodka",
            "1 to 2 tbsp sugar (optional)"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Pit and halve the cherries. As in all vodka recipes, it is important that the flesh of the fruit be somehow exposed.",
            "Fill a jar with the cherries, but do not pack it. Pour the vodka on top and seal tightly. Leave in a dark place, preferably for at least 2 weeks\u2014or up to 6 months. At the end of that time, open the jar and strain. If you have a very fine-mesh strainer, that will do. If not, use an ordinary strainer lined with a cheesecloth or even a coffee filter. Set the strainer over a large bowl, ideally one from which you'll be able to easily pour afterward. Pour the vodka mixture through the strainer and allow the fruit to sit, seeping liquid, for a good hour or so, stirring a bit and pressing if need be to make the liquid go through.",
            "Now taste the vodka. Add sugar if you want an after-dinner liqueur, or leave it out if you want something sharper. Pour (or ladle) into a decorative bottle."
