        "title": "Salt-and-Pepper Rib Eye ",
        "ingredients": [
            "1 1 1/2\"-2\" bone-in rib eye (about 2 pounds)",
            "2 teaspoons kosher salt, divided",
            "1 teaspoon coarsely ground black pepper",
            "Coarse sea salt"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Put steak on a wire rack set on a rimmed baking sheet. Pat dry with paper towels. Season with 1/2 teaspoon salt per side. Chill uncovered for up to 3 hours. Remove steak from refrigerator 1 hour before grilling and let come to room temperature. Pat dry with paper towels. Season again with 1/2 teaspoon salt; press in 1/2 teaspoon pepper per side so pieces adhere. Build a two-zone fire in a charcoal grill for direct (medium-high coals) and indirect (medium-low coals) heat. Alternatively, heat a gas grill to high just before cooking, leaving one burner on low. Sear steak over direct heat, flipping once, until nicely charred, 3-4 minutes per side. (If a flare-up occurs, use tongs to gently slide the steak to a cooler part of the grill.) Move steak to indirect heat and continue grilling, flipping once, 3-4 minutes per side. Using tongs, lift steak and sear both edges (the bone side and the fat-cap side) for 1-2 minutes per side to render out some of the fat. Grill steak to desired temperature, 14-18 minutes total or until an instant-read thermometer registers 120\u00b0F for rare (steak will carry over to 125\u00b0F, or medium-rare, as it rests). Transfer steak to a carving board; let rest for 10 minutes. Slice across the grain, season with coarse sea salt, and serve.",
