            "1/2 teaspoon Chinese five-spice powder",
            "1/4 teaspoon salt",
            "1/8 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper",
            "1 teaspoon olive oil",
            "1/2 pound whole-wheat pizza dough",
            "3 tablespoons hoisin sauce",
            "1 cup baby spinach, chopped",
            "1/2 cup shredded part-skim mozzarella",
            "1/2 red bell pepper, cored, seeded and diced",
            "4 scallions, thinly sliced",

        "instructions": [
            "Heat oven to 400\u00b0F. Sprinkle duck with five-spice powder, salt and pepper. Heat oil in a medium skillet over high heat. Cook duck until browned, 4 to 5 minutes per side. Transfer skillet to oven; bake duck until outside is cooked but inside is rare, 8 to 10 minutes. Cool 4 to 5 minutes. Thinly slice on the diagonal into 8 pieces, then cut each in half. Set aside. Form dough into 8 even balls, then flatten to form 3-inch disks and place on an ungreased baking sheet. Spread hoisin sauce on crusts with a pastry brush. Top with spinach, cheese, bell pepper and duck. Bake until cheese is melted and bubbly, 20 to 25 minutes. Remove and garnish with scallions and sesame seeds."
