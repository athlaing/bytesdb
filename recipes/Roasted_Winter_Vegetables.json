            "2 lb/910 kg winter squash or pumpkin, parsnips, carrots, beets/beetroots, or a mix",
            "2 medium red or yellow onions, quartered",
            "Extra-virgin olive oil",

            "Preheat the oven to 400\u00b0F/200\u00b0C/gas 6. Peel and cut the vegetables into equal sized pieces, about 1-in/2.5-cm chunks. Toss vegetables and onions in olive oil in a large bowl and season generously with salt and pepper. Spread the pieces out in a single layer on one or two roasting pans/trays so that the vegetables don't touch. Roast until the veggies are lightly browned and just tender, 45 minutes to 1 hour, depending on the vegetable. Remove and toss with additional olive oil. Season with salt and pepper and garnish with parsley before serving.",
