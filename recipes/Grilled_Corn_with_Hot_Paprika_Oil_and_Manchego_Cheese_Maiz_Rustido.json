        "ingredients": [
            "1 lime",
            "3 ears of corn, husks and silk removed",
            "1 teaspoon hot piment\u00f3n (smoked paprika)",
            "4 teaspoons extra-virgin olive oil",
            "1 ounce aged Manchego cheese",

        "instructions": [
            "Heat a grill to high. (As an alternative, you could use a rack set over a gas burner.)",
            "Trim the top and bottom off the lime. Remove and reserve the zest. Slice between the membranes to release the lime segments. Reserve in a large bowl. Grill the corn, turning to char evenly, until dark brown all over and tender, about 5 minutes. When cool enough to handle, cut the kernels off the cobs. Transfer to the bowl containing the lime segments and toss until well mixed. Divide among serving dishes.",
            "Mix the piment\u00f3n and oil in a small bowl and drizzle all over the corn. Shave the cheese directly over the corn mixture with a microplane, then sprinkle the lime zest on top. Sprinkle with Maldon salt and serve immediately."
