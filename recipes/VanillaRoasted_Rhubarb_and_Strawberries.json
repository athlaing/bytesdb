        "title": "Vanilla-Roasted Rhubarb and Strawberries ",
        "ingredients": [
            "4 rhubarb stalks (about 1 pound), trimmed, cut on a sharp diagonal into 2-inch pieces",
            "12 large strawberries (about 1/2 pound), hulled and halved",
            "1/4 cup bourbon or water",
            "1/4 cup sugar",
            "1 4-inch piece of vanilla bean, split lengthwise",
            "Greek yogurt, honey, chopped pistachios"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Combine rhubarb, strawberries, bourbon, and sugar in a medium bowl. Scrape in seeds from vanilla bean. Cut bean into 4 pieces and add to bowl; stir mixture until sugar begins to dissolve.",
            "Place four 16x12\" sheets of parchment paper, or heavy-duty foil if grilling, on a work surface. Divide mixture evenly among sheets, arranging on one side of each sheet. Fold parchment over mixture and crimp edges tightly to form a sealed packet. DO AHEAD: Foil packets can be made 4 hours ahead; parchment packets should not be made ahead. Chill. Let stand at room temperature for 15 minutes before continuing.",
            "Preheat oven to 425\u00b0F. Place packets on a small rimmed baking sheet. Alternatively, build a medium fire in a charcoal grill, or heat a gas grill to medium-high. Bake or grill packets until rhubarb is tender but not mushy (carefully open 1 packet to check; steam will escape), 10-12 minutes for thinner rhubarb, 14-16 minutes for thicker. Carefully cut open packets. Transfer mixture to bowls. Top with yogurt, honey, and pistachios."
