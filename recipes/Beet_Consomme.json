            "1 1/4 to 1 1/2 lb smoked turkey legs or wings",
            "2 carrots, cut into 1/2-inch pieces",
            "2 celery ribs, cut into 1/2-inch pieces",
            "1 large onion, cut into 1/2-inch pieces",

        "instructions": [
            "Boil beets, covered, in water (4 quarts) in a 6- to 8-quart pot over moderate heat until tender, about 40 minutes. Transfer beets with a slotted spoon to a plate to cool slightly, reserving cooking water. When beets are cool enough to handle, slip off skins. Cut 1 beet into 1/4-inch dice and reserve for garnish. Cut remaining beets into 1/2-inch pieces and return to cooking liquid in pot. Add turkey, carrots, celery, onion, garlic, dill sprigs, bay leaf, salt, and peppercorns and simmer, partially covered, 1 1/2 to 2 hours. Pour soup through a dampened cheesecloth-lined sieve set into a 3-quart heavy saucepan, discarding solids. Measure soup: If there is more than 6 cups, boil in cleaned pot until reduced; if there is less, add enough water to total 6 cups.",
            "Skim fat from consomm\u00e9, then add lemon juice and sugar and heat until hot.",
            "Divide diced beet and chopped dill among 8 shallow soup plates and ladle consomm on top."
