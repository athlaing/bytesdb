Add onion and tortilla pieces and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened and lightly browned, about 3 minutes. Add garlic and remaining 1 tsp. cumin and cook, stirring, until fragrant, 30\u201360 seconds. Immediately add broth, tomatoes, chiles and sauce, 1 tsp. salt, and 1/2 tsp. pepper. Cover pot, increase heat to high, and bring to a gentle simmer. Uncover, reduce heat to medium, and add chicken. Gently simmer over medium heat until chicken is cooked through, about 5 minutes.",
