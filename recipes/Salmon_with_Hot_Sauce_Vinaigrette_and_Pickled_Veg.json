        "ingredients": [
            "4 (5\u20136-ounce) skin-on, boneless salmon fillets",
            "Kosher salt",
            "2 tablespoons vegetable oil, plus more for salmon",
            "8 ounces daikon, red radishes, carrots, and/or cucumbers, very thinly sliced",
            "2 tablespoons seasoned rice vinegar",
            "3 tablespoons mild hot sauce (such as Cholula)",
            "2 tablespoons fresh lime juice",
            "Cooked rice (for serving)",
            "1 cup cilantro leaves with tender stems",
            "1/4 cup sliced chives"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Preheat oven to 250\u00b0F. Place salmon, skin side down, on a rimmed baking sheet; season with salt and coat flesh lightly with oil. Bake until just cooked through (flesh will flake easily but still be slightly firm in the very center), 20\u201325 minutes.",
            "Meanwhile, place daikon or whatever vegetables you\u2019re using in a small bowl and season with salt. Massage gently with your hands to soften. Drain off any liquid that forms. Add vinegar and toss to coat. Cover and chill until ready to use (this will help vegetables stay firm).",
            "Whisk hot sauce, lime juice, and 2 Tbsp. oil in a small bowl. Season vinaigrette with salt.",
            "Divide rice among bowls. Break up salmon into pieces and arrange on top. Drizzle vinaigrette over. Add cilantro and chives to vegetables; spoon over salmon."
