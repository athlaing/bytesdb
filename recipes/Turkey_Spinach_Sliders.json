        "ingredients": [
            "1/2 bunch flat-leaf spinach, thick stems removed, leaves chopped (about 4 cups)",
            "4 scallions, thinly sliced",
            "1 garlic clove, finely chopped",
            "1 pound ground turkey",
            "3/4 teaspoon ground cumin",
            "Kosher salt, freshly ground pepper",
            "3 tablespoons olive oil",
            "12 slider buns or small dinner rolls, split, lightly toasted (for serving)",
            "Mayonnaise, sliced red onion, and pickle slices (for serving)"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Combine spinach, scallions, garlic, turkey, and cumin in a medium bowl; season with salt and pepper. Using a fork, mix gently just to combine. Form turkey mixture into twelve 1/2\"-thick patties.",
            "Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Working in 2 batches, cook patties until golden brown and cooked through (resist the temptation to press down on patties with your spatula while cooking), about 5 minutes per side. Transfer to a plate.",
            "Serve turkey-spinach patties on buns with mayonnaise, onion, and pickles.",
            "DO AHEAD: Patties can be formed 1 day ahead. Cover and chill. Bring to room temperature before cooking."
