            "Combine the wine, water and honey in a medium-sized saucepan. Add the chicken and bring to heat slowly. (Were you making a larger quantity, you would use a whole chicken.) While the stock is simmering, peel and grate the beetroot. Add to the soup and top up with more wine or water as it reduces. Cook for about 1 1/2 hours. Take out the chicken, skin and shred the meat from the bone and return some or most of it to your serving bowl. Skim the fat from the surface of the soup, season with salt and pepper, pour over the meat and serve.",
