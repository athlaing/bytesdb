        "ingredients": [
            "1/2 cup balsamic vinegar",
            "1 cup unsalted butter, at room temperature",
            "3 tablespoons honey",
            "2 tablespoons chopped fresh basil",
            "1 teaspoon salt",
            "4 sweet yellow plantains, unpeeled"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "1. Prepare a medium fire in the grill.",
            "2. In a small saucepan over high heat, boil the vinegar to reduce its volume to 1/4 cup.",
            "3. In a small bowl, combine the reduced vinegar with the butter, honey, basil, and salt. Using a whisk, vigorously whip the butter until smooth and all ingredients are blended.",
            "4. With a paring knife, make a shallow cut into the curved side of each plantain lengthwise, from end to end. Repeat the process, making the second cut 1/2 inch away from the first. Remove the 1/2-inch piece of peel, then, using your fingers, gently pry away the peel from the sides of each plantain. Next, take some balsamic butter and spread generously over the entire inside of each plantain, leaving the peel on the outside intact.",
            "5. Place the plantains on the outer perimeter of the grill to receive indirect heat. Grill for about 1 hour, basting with the remaining balsamic butter.",
            "6. To serve, place whole plantains on a serving plate. Using a soup spoon, scoop out spoonfuls of the plantain flesh to serve individual portions."
