            "In a baking pan soak skewers in warm water 20 minutes. While skewers are soaking, in a blender blend cream, spices, salt, onion, and garlic. Cut chicken and beef crosswise into 1/4-inch-thick strips and in a bowl toss with cream mixture. Marinate chicken and beef, covered, at room temperature 15 minutes.",
