            "1 cup finely chopped mushrooms",
            "1 green bell pepper, seeded and diced",
            "3 garlic cloves, minced",
            "2 pounds ground beef",
            "1 (28-ounce can) diced tomatoes",
            "1 (6-ounce can) tomato paste",
            "1 teaspoon kosher salt",
            "1 teaspoon black pepper",
            "1 (30-ounce container) whole milk ricotta cheese",
            "1 pound mozzarella, grated",
            "1 cup grated Parmesan cheese",
            "2 large eggs",
            "4 tablespoons minced parsley",
            "4 tablespoons minced basil"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "1. Boil the lasagna noodles in a large pot of salted water until al dente. Drain, rinse with cold water to cool, and lay flat on a sheet of foil. Set aside.",
            "2. In a large pot, heat the olive oil over medium-high heat. Add the onion, mushrooms, bell pepper, and garlic and saut\u00e9 for 4 to 5 minutes, until the vegetables are starting to soften.",
            "3. Remove the veggie mixture from the pan. Add the ground beef to the pan and cook, stirring occasionally, until it's totally browned. Drain the excess fat and add the diced tomatoes, tomato paste, 1/2 teaspoon of the salt, 1/2 teaspoon of the pepper, and the veggie mixture. Stir to combine. Let the mixture simmer on low heat for 30 minutes.",
            "4. To make the filling, combine the ricotta, 1/2 cup of the mozzarella, 3/4 cup of the Parmesan, the eggs, the remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper, 3 tablespoons of the parsley, and 3 tablespoons of the basil. Stir to combine.",
            "5. To assemble, spoon a thin layer of sauce into the bottom of a 9 x 13-inch baking pan OR five 6-inch disposable foil loaf pans. Spread 2 to 3 tablespoons of the ricotta filling on each noodle and roll them up so that the cheese is on the inside of the roll. Lay them sideways in the pans (four will fit in each loaf pan, or you can fill a 9 x 13-inch pan with the roll-ups). Top evenly with the remaining sauce, mozzarella, and Parmesan.",
            "6. Follow the instructions to freeze below. If you're making the roll-ups right away, preheat the oven to 375\u00b0F, place the pan(s) on a baking sheet, and bake for 20 minutes, until hot and bubbly.",
            "7. Serve with salad and a hunk of bread. Convenient and wonderfully good!"
