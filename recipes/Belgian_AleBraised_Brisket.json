        "instructions": [
            "Season brisket with salt. Wrap tightly in plastic and chill at least 8 hours.",
            "Let brisket sit at room temperature 1 hour.",
            "Preheat oven to 400\u00b0F. Combine mustard, brown sugar, and ginger in a small bowl. Unwrap brisket, place on a wire rack set inside a large rimmed baking sheet, and rub mustard mixture all over brisket. Roast until top is nicely browned, 30\u201340 minutes.",
            "Remove brisket from oven and reduce oven temperature to 300\u00b0F.",
            "Meanwhile, heat bacon fat in a large heavy ovenproof pot over medium heat. Add onions; season with salt and cook, stirring often, until deep golden brown, 8\u201310 minutes. Reduce heat to medium-low, add flour, and cook, stirring often, until mixture smells nutty, about 4 minutes. Add bay leaf, ale, and stock. Bring to a simmer. Add brisket, cover, and transfer to oven. Braise, turning every 30 minutes, until fork-tender, 3\u20134 hours. Discard bay leaf.",
            "Transfer brisket to a cutting board and let rest at least 20 minutes.",
            "If braising liquid is thin, bring to a boil, reduce, and simmer, skimming surface as needed, until thick enough to coat a spoon; season with salt, if needed. Slice brisket against the grain. Serve with braising liquid.",
            "DO AHEAD: Brisket can be braised 2 days ahead. Cover and chill in braising liquid."
