            "Make dough: Stir together yeast, milk, and sugar in bowl of a stand mixer fitted with paddle attachment (or in a bowl to mix by hand) and let stand until foamy, about 5 minutes. (If mixture doesn't foam, start over with new yeast.) Add flour, salt, egg, and butter and mix at low speed (or stir) until a dough forms. Increase speed to medium-high and beat 3 minutes (or knead by hand 5 minutes). Sprinkle dough lightly with flour and cover bowl with a kitchen towel (not terry cloth). Let dough rise in a draft-free place at warm room temperature until doubled, 1 1/2 to 2 hours.",
