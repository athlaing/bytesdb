            "Heat a dry 12-inch heavy skillet (not nonstick) over medium-high heat until hot. Pat steak dry and sprinkle with 1 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper, then sear, without turning, 5 minutes (reduce heat if necessary to prevent scorching). Turn steak over and cook 5 to 6 minutes more for medium-rare. Transfer to a cutting board and let stand 5 minutes.",
