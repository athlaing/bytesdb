            "Preheat oven to 500\u00b0F. Lay 2 sheets of foil (each about 1\u001a feet long) on a work surface with long sides overlapping by about 4 inches. Cut 2 (12-inch) lengths from banana leaf and center 1 on foil. Put pork on banana leaf and sprinkle with salt and liquid smoke. Cover top of pork with other 12-inch length of banana leaf and 2 overlapping sheets of foil (each about 1 1/2 feet long). Crimp edges of foil tightly to form a packet and put in a large roasting pan. Add 1\u001a inches of water and cover pan tightly with more foil. Bake pork in middle of oven 4 hours. Pour off liquid from pan and, when pork is just cool enough to handle, shred with 2 forks in a bowl. Serve warm.",
