            "Assembly: Portion beef into 4 loosely packed balls (5 oz. each). Heat a large cast-iron skillet over medium-high until just beginning to smoke. Add 2 Tbsp. oil, then all 4 balls of meat. Firmly smash down on meat with a heavy metal spatula to create a craggy-edged 4\"-diameter patty; season with salt and pepper. Cook, undisturbed, until deeply charred underneath, about 3 minutes. Flip and season other side with salt and pepper; cook to medium, about 3 minutes. Transfer to a plate and let rest. Carefully wipe out skillet with a paper towel, leaving only a light coating of oil. Set skillet over medium heat. Working in 2 batches, toast buns, cut side down, until golden brown, about 1 minute. Transfer to a clean surface. Heat remaining 2 Tbsp. oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium. Crack eggs into skillet and cook until whites are just set and edges are crisp, about 4 minutes. Season with salt. Spread insides of both tops and bottoms of buns with a heaping tablespoonful of salsa verde. Place a burger on each bottom bun, top with an egg, sunny side up, and close burger.",
