        "ingredients": [
            "1/4 cup (60 ml) fresh lime juice",
            "2 tablespoons fish sauce",
            "1 large garlic clove, minced",
            "1/4 red or green jalape\u00f1o, unseeded and thinly sliced crosswise, or more to taste",
            "1 packed tablespoon light brown sugar"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "In a small bowl, whisk together the lime juice, fish sauce, garlic, jalape\u00f1os, and brown sugar. (Or, in a 12-ounce/180-ml or larger jar with a lid, combine the ingredients, cover, then shake vigorously.) Dip a piece of lettuce in the dressing and check the seasonings; add more jalape\u00f1os, if you like. The sauce should have a balance of hot, sweet, sour, and salty, which is typical of Thai foods. Keep, covered, in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks.",
