        "title": "Acorn Squash Pur\u00e9e ",
        "ingredients": [
            "3 acorn squash, halved, the seeds and strings discarded",
            "2 tablespoons unsalted butter",
            "freshly grated nutmeg to taste"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Sprinkle the cavities of the squash halves with salt and arrange the squash, inverted, in one layer in a buttered baking dish. Bake the squash, covered with foil, in the middle of a preheated 375\u00b0F. oven for 1 hour and let it cool until it can be handled. Scoop out the squash pulp, discarding the skin, and in a food processor pur\u00e9e it with the butter. Transfer the pur\u00e9e to a saucepan and simmer it, stirring occasionally, until the excess liquid is evaporated. Season the pur\u00e9e with the nutmeg and salt and pepper. The pur\u00e9e may be made 1 day in advance and kept covered and chilled."
