            "Increase temperature to 400\u00b0F.",
            "In shallow baking pan put 1 tablespoon oil and add corn, turning it to coat. Season corn with salt and roast in middle of oven, turning it once halfway through roasting, about 30 minutes. Cool corn to room temperature. Cut corn kernels from cobs and transfer to a bowl.",
            "Cut chorizo into 1/2-inch cubes. Coarsely chop onion and celery and in a large skillet cook in butter over moderate heat, stirring occasionally, until tender, about 10 minutes. Add vegetables and any butter remaining in skillet to corn. In skillet cook chorizo in remaining tablespoon oil over moderate heat, stirring occasionally, until browned and with a slotted spoon transfer to paper towels to drain.",
