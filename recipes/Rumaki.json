            "1/4 lb chicken livers, trimmed and rinsed",
            "1/4 cup soy sauce",
            "1 tablespoon finely grated peeled fresh ginger",
            "2 tablespoons packed light brown sugar",
            "1/2 teaspoon curry powder",
            "12 canned water chestnuts, drained and halved horizontally",
            "8 bacon slices (1/2 pound), cut crosswise into thirds",
            "24 wooden toothpicks"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Cut chicken livers into 24 (roughly 1/2-inch) pieces. Stir together soy sauce, ginger, brown sugar, and curry powder. Add livers and water chestnuts and toss to coat. Marinate, covered and chilled, 1 hour.",
            "While livers marinate, soak toothpicks in cold water 1 hour. Drain well.",
            "Preheat broiler.",
            "Remove livers and chestnuts from marinade and discard marinade. Place 1 piece of bacon on a work surface and put 1 piece of liver and 1 chestnut in center. Wrap bacon around liver and chestnut and secure with a toothpick. Make 23 more rumaki in same manner.",
            "Broil rumaki on rack of a broiler pan 2 inches from heat, turning once, until bacon is crisp and livers are cooked but still slightly pink inside (unwrap 1 to check for doneness), 5 to 6 minutes. Serve immediately."
