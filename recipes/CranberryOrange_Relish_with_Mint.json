            "Pulse two 12-ounce bags fresh (or frozen, thawed) cranberries in a food processor until coarsely chopped. Transfer to a large bowl. Finely grate 2 teaspoons orange zest from 1 of 4 navel oranges; set aside. Using a sharp paring knife, remove peel and white pith from oranges. Working over a medium bowl, cut between membranes to release orange segments. Coarsely chop segments; add to cranberries. Stir 3/4 cup sugar, 1/2 cup minced red onion, 1/4 cup chopped fresh mint, 1 tablespoon minced peeled ginger, and reserved zest into cranberry mixture.
