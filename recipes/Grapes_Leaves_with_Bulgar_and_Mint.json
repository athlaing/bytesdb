        "instructions": [
            "Combine bulgur, green onions, tomatoes, chopped dill, chopped mint, 1/2 cup olive oil, 1 tablespoon lemon juice, cumin, 1 1/4 teaspoons salt, and 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper in large bowl; toss. Let soak at room temperature at least 30 minutes and up to 1 hour.",
            "Line bottom of large pot with 2 layers of grape leaves, covering bottom completely; set aside.",
            "Open 1 grape leaf and lay flat, veined side down, on work surface (if leaf is small or broken, patch with 1 additional grape leaf). Place 1 tablespoon bulgur filling atop center of leaf. Fold stem end of leaf up over bulgur filling, then fold in sides of leaf over filling and roll up leaf tightly, enclosing filling completely. Place on baking sheet. Repeat with remaining grape leaves and bulgur filling.",
            "Place filled grape leaves, seam side down, in bottom of grape-leaf-lined pot, fitting snugly together and layering filled leaves atop one another as needed. Pour enough water over filled grape leaves to cover generously (about 6 cups), then pour 1/4 cup lemon juice and 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil over. Place tart pan bottom atop leaves in pot; top with heavy heatproof dish or plate to weigh down. Bring liquid to simmer. Cover pot and reduce heat to very low; continue to simmer until bulgur filling is tender, 45 to 55 minutes.",
            "Remove from heat and allow grape leaves to cool in liquid to room temperature. Gently remove filled grape leaves from liquid and place on platter. DO AHEAD: Can be made 3 days ahead. Cover and chill.",
            "Garnish platter with dill sprigs and mint sprigs and serve."
