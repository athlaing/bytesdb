        "ingredients": [
            "8 cups of bread, cubed or torn into 1 1/2-inch pieces",
            "4 cups mixed berries, such as blackberry, raspberry, strawberry, or blueberry (in any combination)",
            "8 eggs",
            "1 1/2 cups sugar",
            "3 cups half and half",
            "1 tablespoon vanilla",
            "1 teaspoon cinnamon",
            "1/4 teaspoon nutmeg",
            "powdered sugar for dusting"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Preheat oven to 375\u00b0 F. Prepare eight individual souffl\u00e9 cups (1-cup capacity) with cooking spray. In a large bowl, toss the bread cubes with the berries to distribute evenly. In another bowl, beat the eggs with a whisk or electric mixer on low speed until frothy. Add the sugar and beat until well blended. Add the half and half, vanilla, cinnamon, and nutmeg and continue beating on low speed until well blended. Fill souffl\u00e9 cups with bread and berry mixture, mounding it a bit on top. Pour egg mixture over the bread and berries, filling evenly to the rim.",
            "Place the souffl\u00e9 cups in large ovenproof baking dish and pour boiling water into the dish until it reaches about halfway up the sides of the souffl\u00e9 cups. Bake for 30 to 35 minutes, or until a cake tester or toothpick placed in the center of the puddings comes out clean. Remove from oven and allow to cool. These can be made one day ahead of the shower; simply refrigerate overnight and serve at room temperature. Just before serving, dust each top with powdered sugar."
