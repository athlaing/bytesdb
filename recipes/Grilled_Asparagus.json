        "title": "Grilled Asparagus ",
        "ingredients": [
            "1 pound fresh asparagus",
            "4 tablespoons olive oil",
            "1 teaspoon kosher salt (use salt according to taste)"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Trim off the tough bottom of the spear by grasping each end and bending it gently until it snaps at its natural point of tenderness\u2014usually two-thirds of the way down the spear. If the spear is less than 6 inches long, chances are it has already been trimmed for you. Alternatively, you can cut the ends off with a knife.",
            "Coat each spear with olive oil by placing clean, dry spears in a resealable plastic bag, pour in the oil, and massage spears to coat each one. Sprinkle with salt and massage again. Leave the asparagus in the bag until ready to cook.",
            "Place on the cooking grate crosswise so it won't fall through. Grill for 10 to 15 minutes (depending on the size and thickness of the stalks), turning occasionally to expose all sides to the heat. Asparagus should begin to brown in spots (indicating that its natural sugars are caramelizing) but should not be allowed to char.",
            "Remove from grill and serve immediately\u2014eating spears with your fingers enhances the experience."
