        "ingredients": [
            "4 ounces bacon (about 4 slices), cut crosswise into 1/4\" strips",
            "2 tablespoons (or more) olive oil",
            "1 pound brussels sprouts, trimmed, halved",
            "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt",
            "1/4 cup dates, pitted, chopped"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Cook bacon in a large skillet over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until partially crisped, 5\u20137 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer bacon to paper towels, reserving fat in skillet. Add 2 Tbsp. oil to fat and heat over medium. Working in batches and adding more oil if needed, add brussels sprouts in a single layer, cut side down, and sear, without stirring, until well-browned, about 3 minutes. Season with salt, toss to coat, then stir in bacon and dates. Stir in 3/4 cup water, increase heat to medium-high, and cook, mashing dates with the back of a wooden spoon, until dates have dissolved and brussels sprouts are well-glazed, about 2 minutes.",
