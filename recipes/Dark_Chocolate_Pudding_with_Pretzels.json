            "1/4 teaspoon kosher salt",
            "4 large egg yolks",
            "2 cups whole milk",
            "1 cup heavy cream",
            "1/2 vanilla bean, split lengthwise",

        "instructions": [
            "Whisk sugar, cornstarch, cocoa powder, and salt in a medium saucepan. Whisk egg yolks, milk, and cream in a large bowl; scrape in vanilla seeds and add pod. Gradually whisk milk mixture into dry ingredients, whisking until smooth. Bring mixture to boil over medium-high heat, whisking constantly. Reduce heat to medium and continue cooking, whisking, until mixture is thick enough to coat a spoon, about 4 minutes. Remove from heat and whisk in chocolate, butter, and vanilla extract (mixture will thicken). Strain through a fine-mesh sieve into another large bowl. Divide pudding among small jars or bowls. Press plastic wrap directly onto surface of pudding; chill at least 4 hours. Top pudding with whipped cream and pretzels just before serving. DO AHEAD: Pudding can be made 3 days ahead. Keep chilled.",
