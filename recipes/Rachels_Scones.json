            "1 tablespoon baking powder",

        "instructions": [
            "Preheat oven to 425\u00b0F. and grease a large baking sheet.",
            "In a large bowl whisk together flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt. With a pastry blender or fingertips blend in margarine and butter until mixture resembles coarse meal. Stir in eggs, 1/4 cup milk, and currants until just combined. Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead dough gently a few times, or until dry ingredients are well incorporated.",
            "With a lightly floured rolling pin roll out dough into a 1/2-inch-thick round, about 10 inches in diameter. With a 2-inch round cutter or rim of a glass dipped in flour cut out as many rounds as possible, transferring to baking sheet. Gather scraps into a ball and reroll. Cut out more rounds in same manner. Brush scones with remaining 2 tablespoons milk and bake in middle of oven 15 minutes, or until golden."
