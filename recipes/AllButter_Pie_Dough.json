        "ingredients": [
            "1 3/4 (196 grams) sticks unsalted butter, divided",
            "1 tablespoon (12 grams) red wine vinegar",
            "1/2 cup (118 grams) cold water",
            "2 1/4 cups (333 grams) all-purpose flour",
            "2 1/4 teaspoons (6.5 grams) kosher salt",
            "1/2 tablespoon (6.5 grams) granulated sugar"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Cut the butter into 1/2-inch (13-mm) cubes. Freeze 5 Tbsp. (70 grams) for 20 minutes or overnight; chill the remaining 1 1/8 sticks in the refrigerator until ready to use.",
            "Stir the red wine vinegar into the cold water and set aside.",
            "Combine the flour, salt, and sugar in the bowl of a food processor and pulse 5 or 6 times to combine.",
            "Add the chilled butter and mix for 25 to 30 seconds, until the mixture resembles coarse meal.",
            "Add the frozen butter and pulse 15 to 20 times, until the butter is in pea-sized pieces.",
            "Add 6 tablespoons of the vinegar water and pulse 6 times. The dough should start to look crumbly. Test the dough by squeezing a small amount in the palm of your hand. If it easily holds together, it is done. If not, add 1/2 Tbsp. of the vinegar water and pulse 3 more times. Repeat this process as needed until the dough holds together.",
            "Transfer the dough to a lightly floured work surface and knead together until smooth; dough should never come together in the food processor.",
            "Divide the dough into 2 equal parts and roll each into a ball. Flatten the balls slightly and wrap separately in plastic wrap. Let the dough rest in the refrigerator until ready to use, at least 20 minutes but preferably overnight."
