            "Rinse the chicken pieces with cold water and pat them dry with paper towels. Sprinkle the chicken with the salt and pepper, and with the garlic and poultry seasoning if you are using them. Cover and set aside for 15 minutes, or refrigerate for up to 12 hours. Pour the oil into a deep skillet and heat it to 350\u00b0F. Meanwhile, place the flour in a large self-sealing food storage bag. Add the chicken pieces, a few at a time, and shake to thoroughly coat them. Dust off any excess flour. Fry the chicken, a few pieces at a time, in the hot oil for 20 to 30 minutes, turning once, until they are golden brown and cooked through. Drain on paper towels and serve warm or at room temperature.",
