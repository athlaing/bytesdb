        "ingredients": [
            "1 1/2 cups paper-thin onion slices",
            "1 pound Yukon Gold potatoes, peeled, coarsely grated on large holes of box grater or in processor (about 2 1/2 cups)",
            "1 teaspoon salt, divided",
            "2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Preheat oven to 425\u00b0F. Butter large rimmed nonstick baking sheet. Place onion in large bowl. Toss potatoes with 1/2 teaspoon salt in medium bowl. Let stand 5 minutes. Using hands, squeeze out excess liquid from potatoes. Add potatoes, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and melted butter to onion. Toss to coat.",
            "Divide mixture into 4 mounds on prepared baking sheet, spacing apart. Roast 15 minutes, then turn mounds over with spatula, pressing down to flatten to 4-inch-diameter rounds (cakes will still be soft). Reduce oven temperature to 350\u00b0F; bake until cakes are golden and crisp around edges, about 45 minutes longer."
