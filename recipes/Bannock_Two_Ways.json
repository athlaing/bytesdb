            "For Greg\u2019s Bella Coola Bannock: Combine the flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt. Using a pastry cutter or knife, cut in the butter until the pieces are pea-sized. Mix in the egg, then pour in about 1/4 cup (60 mL) of milk. Mix together just until a dough forms, adding more milk if needed. Divide the dough into 10 to 12 biscuit-sized pieces. In a large frying pan, pour in about 1/4 inch (6 mm) of oil and heat over medium-high. When the oil is hot, fry the bannock\u2014being careful not to crowd them\u2014until golden brown. Serve immediately with maple syrup and flaky sea salt.",

            "For Doreen Crowe\u2019s Bannock: In a large bowl, mix the flour, baking powder, salt, and water together to form a dough. If the dough is a bit dry, add more water 1 Tbsp (15 mL) at a time. Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and roll out into a 9\u00d712-inch (23\u00d730-cm) rectangle about 1/4-inch (6-mm) thick. Cut into approximately 3\u00d73-inch (8\u00d78-cm) squares. Heat about 1/4 inch (6 mm) of oil in a large frying pan over medium-high heat, and fry the bannock\u2014being careful not to crowd them\u2014until golden brown, about 2 minutes on each side. Serve warm.",
