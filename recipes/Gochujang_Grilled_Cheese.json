            "4 slices good-quality crusty Italian bread, such as ciabatta",
            "2 tablespoons mayonnaise (preferably Duke's)",
            "2 small pickled okra, thinly sliced",

        "instructions": [
            "Mix Gruy\u00e8re, white cheddar, fontina cheese, garlic, parsley, gochujang, mayonnaise, and onion in a medium bowl until well combined.",
            "Assemble the sandwiches: Heat a large cast-iron or non-stick skillet over medium-high. Fry pancetta until crispy and fat has rendered, 3-5 minutes per side. Wipe out skillet and reserve for sandwiches. Spread 1 side of each slice of bread with 2 Tbsp. mayonnaise total (doing this before toasting helps ensure a golden brown and crispy grilled cheese). Flip 2 slices over so mayo side is face down. Divide cheese spread between these 2 slices. Top each slice with a piece of pancetta, half of sliced okra, half of bean sprouts, and a second slice of bread with the mayo on the outside of the sandwich. Heat reserved skillet over medium-high. Combine oil and butter, stir until butter is melted, and immediately add sandwiches. Cover skillet with a lid or baking sheet to properly melt cheese; toast until bread is crispy and browned, 3\u20135 minutes per side. Cut sandwiches in half and serve immediately.",
