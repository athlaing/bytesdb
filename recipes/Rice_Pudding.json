            "Preheat oven to 325\u00b0F with rack in middle. Butter ramekins. Add 1/2 cup milk, 4 teaspoons rice, 2 teaspoons sugar, and a pinch of salt to each ramekin. Finely grate a little nutmeg over each, then stir to combine. Put ramekins in a shallow baking pan and bake until most of milk is absorbed and tops are golden-brown, about 1 hour (a skin will form). Cool puddings in ramekins on a rack, about 1 hour. Discard skin from puddings, then stir 1 tablespoon cream into each. Puddings can be eaten at room temperature or chilled. If desired, chill puddings, covered, at least 30 minutes.",
