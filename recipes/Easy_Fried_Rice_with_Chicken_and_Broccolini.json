        "instructions": [
            "Heat 1 Tbsp. oil in a large nonstick or cast-iron skillet or wok over high. Reserve about 2 Tbsp. sliced scallion greens; add remaining scallions to oil and cook, tossing occasionally, about 1 minute. Add chicken, 1 tsp. salt, and pepper and cook, stirring, about 2 minutes. Stir in garlic and ginger, then add broccolini and toss until incorporated. Cover and cook until chicken is cooked through and broccolini is tender, 2\u20133 minutes more. Transfer to a large bowl.",
            "Heat remaining 3 Tbsp. oil in skillet over high. Add rice and remaining 1/4 tsp. salt, toss to coat, then press rice into a single layer, and cook, undisturbed, until crisped on the bottom, about 2 minutes. Move rice to one-half of skillet and add eggs to other half. Cook, stirring gently to form curds, until soft set and just cooked through, about 1 minute, then fold into rice.",
            "Fold in snow peas, edamame, soy sauce, and orange juice. Cook, tossing, until warmed through, about 1 minute. Add chicken mixture and toss to combine. Divide among plates, then top with reserved 2 Tbsp. scallions. Drizzle with chili or sesame oil, if using."
