            "4 pounds boneless loin of pork",
            "1/4 cup olive oil",
            "2 teaspoons powdered sage",
            "1 teaspoon dried thyme",
            "1 teaspoon minced garlic",
            "Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste",
            "1 tablespoon packed dark brown sugar",
            "1/4 pound shelled pecan halves"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Rub the pork loin with olive oil, making sure that it is well covered. Combine the sage, thyme, garlic, salt, pepper and brown sugar in the bowl of a food processor or blender and pulse until you have a thick paste. You may have to add a drizzle of olive oil to get it started. Slather the paste all over the pork loin, cover it with plastic wrap, and refrigerate it over night.",
            "Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Place the pecans in the bowl of a food processor or blender and pulse until they are finely chopped. Roll the pork loin in the crushed pecans and place it in a roasting pan. Make a tent of aluminum foil and arrange it over the pork loin, covering the nuts completely so they won't char.",
            "Roast for 30 minutes; then lower the heat to 350 degrees and continue to roast. After 1 hour and 20 minutes, remove the aluminum foil and continue to roast until the pork is done, approximately 20 minutes more. Serve hot."
