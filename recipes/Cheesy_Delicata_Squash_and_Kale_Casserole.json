Whisk ricotta and cream in a medium bowl until smooth. Add 6 oz. mozzarella, 3/4 tsp. salt, and remaining 1/2 tsp. pepper and whisk to combine. Remove thyme leaves from stems and add to cheese mixture. Coarsely chop garlic, add to cheese mixture, and stir to combine. Transfer hazelnuts to a large bowl. Add panko, 2 Tbsp. oil, and remaining 1/2 tsp. salt and toss to combine. Set aside 1/4 cup panko mixture. Drain raisins.
