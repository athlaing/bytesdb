            "Make the cookies: Arrange the racks in the upper and lower rungs in the oven and preheat the oven to 325\u00b0F. In the bowl of a food processor, pulse 3 tablespoons pistachios until very finely ground and powdery. Set ground pistachios aside. In the bowl of a food processor, combine remaining 1 cup pistachios, sugar, cornstarch, and salt; pulse until very finely ground. Add the egg white, vanilla extract, and almond extract, and pulse until well combined. Drop dough by teaspoonfuls onto two parchment-lined baking sheets, spacing them 1 inch apart. Use a finger dipped in water to gently flatten the pistachio rounds until they are about 1 inch in diameter. Bake until the cookies are set and edges are golden, about 12 minutes. Let the cookies to cool completely, then freeze cookies for 1 hour.",

            "Assemble the cookies: Once the cookies have been frozen, spoon 1/2 teaspoon truffle filling on the flat side of each cookie. Use a butter knife or small offset spatula to shape the filling to a domed point. Freeze cookies until the filling is set, about 15 minutes more. Place cookies on a wire rack placed over a parchment-lined rimmed baking sheet. In a heatproof bowl set over a medium saucepan of barely simmering water, combine the 6 ounces of chocolate and the coconut oil. Stir until mixture is smooth; remove from heat and let cool slightly.",
