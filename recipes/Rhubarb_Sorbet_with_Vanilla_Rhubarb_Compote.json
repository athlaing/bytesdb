Cook mixture over low heat, stirring frequently, until rhubarb has released about 2 cups liquid, 10 to 15 minutes. Increase heat and simmer, stirring frequently, until rhubarb is very tender, 12 to 15 minutes. 3Pur\u00e9e mixture in 2 batches in a blender until very smooth (use caution when blending hot liquids). Transfer pur\u00e9e to a bowl, then set bowl in a larger bowl of ice and cold water and stir occasionally until cold, 10 to 15 minutes.

Add rhubarb slices and return just to a simmer, then remove pan from heat and stir in vanilla gently (to avoid breaking up rhubarb). Cool mixture to room temperature, gently stirring once or twice, about 30 minutes. Chill, covered, until ready to use. Let sorbet soften at room temperature 5 minutes, then serve with compote.",
