            "Slaw and assembly: Bring shallot and oil to a simmer in a small saucepan over medium heat. Cook 1 minute (watch it carefully; you don\u2019t want the shallot to take on any color). Let cool, then pour oil through a fine-mesh sieve into a small bowl; discard shallot. Whisk shallot oil, vinegar, soy sauce, and sugar in a small bowl to combine; season vinaigrette with salt. Trim ends from cucumbers and very thinly slice lengthwise on a mandoline or with a vegetable peeler or sharp knife into long ribbons. Toss cucumbers, arugula, celery, celery leaves, and dates in a large bowl to combine. Drizzle half of dressing over slaw and add 2 Tbsp. drained pickled mustard seeds (save remaining mustard seeds for another use) and toss again to coat. Taste and season with salt. Transfer slaw to a platter and top with sesame seeds. Serve with remaining vinaigrette alongside.",
