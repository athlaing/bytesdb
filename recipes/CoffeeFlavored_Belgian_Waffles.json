        "ingredients": [
            "1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour",
            "1/4 cup granulated sugar",
            "1/4 cup (packed) light brown sugar",
            "2 teaspoons baking powder",
            "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt",
            "1/4 teaspoon baking soda",
            "2 large eggs, room temperature, beaten to blend",
            "2 tablespoons whole-milk ricotta, room temperature",
            "1 1/4 cups buttermilk",
            "2 tablespoons instant espresso powder, plus more for serving",
            "5 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted, plus more for brushing",
            "Pure maple syrup and whipped cream (for serving)",
            "A Belgian waffle iron"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Whisk flour, granulated sugar, brown sugar, baking powder, salt, and baking soda in a medium bowl to combine. Whisk eggs and ricotta in a large bowl just to incorporate, then add buttermilk and 2 Tbsp. espresso powder; whisk until smooth. Whisk in 5 Tbsp. melted butter, then fold in dry ingredients with a rubber spatula, being careful not to overmix (some lumps are okay). Let batter sit uncovered at room temperature 30 minutes to allow the flour to hydrate.",
            "Preheat oven to 200\u00b0F. Set a wire rack inside a rimmed baking sheet and place in oven. Heat waffle iron and brush with butter. Pour 1 cup batter onto iron and cook until waffle is golden brown and cooked through, 5\u20137 minutes. Transfer to wire rack in oven. Repeat with remaining batter, brushing iron with more butter as needed. (Waffles will be limp at first but will crisp up as they sit.)",
            "Serve waffles topped with whipped cream, drizzled with maple syrup, and sprinkled with more espresso powder."
