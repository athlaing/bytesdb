        "title": "French Toast BLT with Roasted Garlic Vinaigrette ",
        "ingredients": [
            "12 thick slices smoked bacon",
            "2 cups heavy cream",
            "5 large eggs",
            "coarse salt and freshly ground black pepper",
            "6 slices challah bread, at least 1 inch thick",
            "2 tbsp canola oil",
            "2 1/2 cups grated Gruy\u00e8re cheese",
            "12 slices ripe tomatoes (about 3 small)",
            "6 cups arugula, cleaned",
            "Roasted-Garlic Vinaigrette"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Preheat the oven to 350\u00b0F. Place the bacon on a rimmed baking sheet and bake until crisp, 10 to 15 minutes. Leave the oven on.",
            "Combine the heavy cream and eggs in a bowl and whisk to thoroughly blend. Season the mixture with salt and pepper to taste. Soak the bread in the mixture for 15 minutes, then turn the slices over and soak for an additional 10 to 15 minutes.",
            "Place a nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add the canola oil. Once the oil is hot (it will shimmer slightly), fry the challah slices on each side until golden brown, working in batches. Transfer the challah to a baking sheet and place in the oven. Bake until the custard is cooked through, 6 to 8 minutes; the bread should souffl\u00e9, or puff up. Remove from the oven, cover each slice with grated cheese, and return the pan to the oven to melt the cheese. Once the cheese is melted, about 4 minutes, remove from the oven. Put 2 slices bacon and 2 slices tomato on each slice of challah and drizzle with some of the vinaigrette. Toss the arugula with the remaining dressing (or enough to coat) and place atop each piece. Serve warm."
