        "ingredients": [
            "1/2 cup sugar plus additional for coating ramekins",
            "two 10-ounce packages frozen raspberries in syrup, thawed",
            "1 tablespoon cornstarch",
            "1 teaspoon balsamic vinegar",
            "4 large eggs",
            "1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Preheat oven to 375\u00b0F. Butter six 1-cup ramekins (4 by 2 inches) and coat with sugar, knocking out excess sugar.",
            "Remove 30 raspberries and drain on paper towels. In a 3-quart saucepan stir together remaining raspberries with syrup, cornstarch, and vinegar. Simmer mixture, stirring, 3 minutes. Pour mixture through a fine sieve into a bowl, pressing hard on solids. Stir in drained raspberries and cool mixture. Raspberry mixture may be made 1 day ahead and chilled, covered.",
            "Separate eggs and in a large bowl with an electric mixer beat together yolks and 6 tablespoons sugar until thick and pale and mixture forms a ribbon when beater is lifted, about 5 minutes. Fold raspberry mixture into yolk mixture until just combined. In another large bowl with cleaned beaters beat whites with cream of tartar and a pinch salt until they just hold soft peaks. Gradually add remaining 2 tablespoons sugar, beating until whites hold stiff peaks. Stir one fourth whites into raspberry mixture to lighten and fold in remaining whites gently but thoroughly.",
            "Divide souffl\u00e9 mixture among ramekins and smooth tops with a knife. Run tip of knife around edges of souffl\u00e9s to aid rising. Bake souffl\u00e9s on a baking sheet in lower third of oven until puffed and golden brown, 18 to 20 minutes. Serve souffl\u00e9s immediately."
