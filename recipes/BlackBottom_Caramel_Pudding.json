            "Bring sugar and water to a boil in a large heavy saucepan over high heat, stirring with a fork until sugar is dissolved. Boil, without stirring, washing down sugar crystals clinging to side of pan with a pastry brush dipped in cold water, until pale golden, 4 to 5 minutes. Continue to cook, without stirring, swirling pan occasionally, until sugar turns a deep amber caramel, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove from heat and carefully add cream in a slow stream (mixture will bubble and steam). Return to low heat and cook, whisking, until smooth.",
