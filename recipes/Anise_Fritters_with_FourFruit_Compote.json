            "Combine powdered sugar and 1/4 cup liqueur in small deep bowl. Add enough water to make medium-thick glaze. Dip fritters halfway into glaze. Arrange fritters glaze side up on plate. (Can be prepared 6 hours ahead. Let stand at room temperature.)",

Place apricots in medium bowl. Strain boiling syrup over apricots. Discard aniseed. Add liqueur to apricots and stir. Cover and let stand at room temperature until apricots are tender, about 8 hours.
