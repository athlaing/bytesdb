        "ingredients": [
            "16 large, ripe plum tomatoes, cut in half lengthwise",
            "2 tbsp muscovado sugar",
            "2/3 cup / 150 ml olive oil",
            "2 tbsp balsamic vinegar",
            "2 onions, thinly sliced",
            "1 1/2 cups / 250 g mograbiah",
            "1 2/3 cups / 400 ml chicken or vegetable stock",
            "A pinch of saffron threads",
            "1 1/2 cups / 250 g couscous",
            "1 tbsp tarragon leaves",
            "1 tbsp nigella seeds",
            "3 1/2 ounces / 100 g Labneh",
            "coarse sea salt and freshly ground black pepper"

        "instructions": [
            "1. Preheat the oven to 300\u00b0F / 150\u00b0C. Arrange the tomato halves, skin side down, on a baking sheet and sprinkle with the sugar, 2 tablespoons of the olive oil, the balsamic vinegar, and some salt and pepper. Place in the oven and bake for 2 hours, until the tomatoes have lost most of their moisture. 2. Meanwhile, put the onions in a large pan with 4 tablespoons of the olive oil and saut\u00e9 over high heat for 10 to 12 minutes, stirring occasionally, until they are a dark golden color. 3. Throw the mograbiah into a large pan of boiling salted water (as for cooking pasta). Simmer for 15 minutes, until it is soft but still retains a bite; some varieties might take less time, so check the instructions on the packet. Drain well and rinse under cold water. 4. In a separate pot, bring the stock to a boil with the saffron and a little salt. Place the couscous in a large bowl and add 3 tablespoons of the olive oil and the boiling stock. Cover with plastic wrap and leave for 10 minutes. 5. Once ready, mix the couscous with a fork or a whisk to get rid of any lumps and to fluff it up. Add the cooked mograbiah, the tomatoes and their juices, the onions and their oil, the tarragon, and half the nigella seeds. Taste and adjust the seasoning and oil. It is likely that it will need a fair amount of salt. Allow the dish to come to room temperature. To serve, arrange it gently on a serving plate, place the labneh on top (in balls or spoonfuls), drizzle with remaining oil, and finish with the rest of the nigella seeds.",
