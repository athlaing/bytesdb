        "title": "Grilled Chicken Breasts Stuffed with Ham and Saga Blue ",
        "ingredients": [
            "1 whole boneless chicken breast with skin (about 1 pound), halved",
            "2 sticks of Saga Blue (each 2 by 1/2 by 1/2 inch)",
            "2 thin slices of cooked ham (each 4 by 4 inches)",
            "1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce",
            "1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice",
            "2 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into pieces"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Insert a sharp paring knife into the thicker end of each chicken breast half and cut a lengthwise pocket carefully, making it as wide as possible without puncturing the sides. Wrap each stick of Saga Blue in a ham slice, enclosing it, insert the packages in the chicken pockets, and seal each opening well with a wooden pick. In a small saucepan bring the Worcestershire sauce and the lemon juice just to a simmer, remove the pan from the heat, and swirl in the butter. Grill the chicken, seasoned with salt and pepper, on an oiled rack set about 6 inches over glowing coals, basting it frequently with the sauce, for 12 minutes on each side. (Do not baste the chicken during the last 2 minutes of grilling, and discard any unused sauce.)",
