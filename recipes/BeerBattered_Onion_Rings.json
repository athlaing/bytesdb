        "ingredients": [
            "2 large yellow onions (about 2 pounds total)",
            "3 cups all-purpose flour, divided",
            "1 1/2 cups cornstarch",
            "2 1/2 teaspoons garlic powder",
            "2 1/2 teaspoons onion powder",
            "2 1/2 teaspoons cayenne pepper",
            "2 1/2 teaspoons granulated sugar",
            "1 1/2 tablespoons kosher salt, plus more for sprinkling",
            "1 1/2 cups Anchor Steam beer",
            "2 cups sparkling mineral water",
            "1 large egg",
            "4 to 6 cups vegetable oil (or more depending on vessel), for frying",
            "deep fry/candy thermometer, 2 heat-safe cooling racks, 2 rimmed baking sheets"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Preheat oven to 250\u00b0F. Set two cooling racks over two rimmed baking sheets.",
            "Cut onions crosswise into 1/2-inch thick slices and separate into rings. Reserve small inner rings for another use. Add 1 cup flour to a large bowl. Toss rings in flour and let sit 30 minutes.",
            "When ready to fry, whisk together remaining 2 cups flour, cornstarch, garlic and onion powder, cayenne, sugar and salt in a large bowl. In another large bowl, whisk together the beer, water, and egg. Gradually whisk the dry mixture to the wet mixture.",
            "Heat an inch of oil in a large pot over medium-high heat until it registers 350\u00b0F on a deep fry/candy thermometer. Working in batches to prevent crowding, dredge the onion rings in the batter and immediately drop into the oil. Cook onion rings, turning once, until golden, about 3 minutes total. Transfer cooked rings to the cooling racks set over the baking sheets. Sprinkle with salt and keep warm in oven while frying remaining batches."
