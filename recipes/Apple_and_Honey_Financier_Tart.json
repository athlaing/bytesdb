            "Sift together the confectioners' sugar, flour, and salt into a bowl.",
            "Place the butter in a food processor and process until smooth, about 15 seconds. Scatter the flour mixture over the butter, add the egg, and process just until the dough forms a mass; do not overmix. Turn the dough out onto the counter and shape into a disc, wrap in plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 2 hours or up to 24 hours. The dough may be well wrapped and frozen for up to 1 month.",
            "Let the dough stand at room temperature for 15 minutes to soften. Flour 2 pieces of parchment paper. Dust the disc of dough lightly with flour and place in between the parchment sheets. Roll the dough into a 12-inch circle. Lift the dough in the parchment, remove 1 sheet, and flip to transfer the dough into the tart pan. Press the dough into the pan and roll the pin over the top of the pan to remove excess dough. Prick the bottom of the tart shell all over with a fork. Chill the tart shell for 20 minutes. (The tart shell can be refrigerated for up to 24 hours.)",
            "Make the financier batter: Preheat the oven to 350\u00b0 F. Melt the butter in a small skillet over medium heat. Reduce the heat to medium-low and cook the butter until it begins to brown and has a nutty fragrance, about 3 minutes. Set aside to cool. In a food processor, pulse the slivered almonds until finely ground, about 45 seconds. Transfer the ground almonds to a medium bowl. Sift the confectioners' sugar over the almonds. Add the flour, cornstarch, and salt and gently whisk to combine. In another medium bowl, combine the cooled browned butter, egg whites, honey, and cream. Scrape the seeds from the vanilla bean (reserve the pod for another use) into the bowl and whisk to combine. Add the dry ingredients and whisk just until combined. Set aside.",
