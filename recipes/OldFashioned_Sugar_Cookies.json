            "1/2 cup lard or vegetable shortening, melted and cooled",
            "1/2 stick (1/4 cup) unsalted butter, melted and cooled",
            "1 cup sugar plus additional for coating the cookies",
            "1 large egg",
            "1 teaspoon vanilla",
            "2 cups all-purpose flour",
            "2 teaspoons baking soda",

        "instructions": [
            "In a large bowl stir together the lard or shortening, the butter, 1 cup of the sugar, the egg, and the vanilla. Into the bowl sift together the flour, the baking soda, and the salt and stir the mixture until it forms a dough. Chill the dough, covered, for at least 2 hours or overnight.",
            "Preheat the oven to 375\u00b0F. Roll rounded tablespoons of the dough into balls, roll the balls in the additional sugar, coating them completely, and arrange them 3 inches apart on lightly greased baking sheets. Flatten the balls with the bottom of a glass dipped in the sugar (the edges will crack slightly) and bake the cookies in batches in the middle of the oven for 8 to 12 minutes, or until they are pale golden. Transfer the cookies to racks and let them cool. The cookies keep in an airtight container for 1 week."
