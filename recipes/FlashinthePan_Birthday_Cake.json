            "Cut pound cake into 1/3-inch-thick slices. Halve each diagonally, forming triangles. Line bottom of 9-inch springform pan with cake by arranging some triangles, points facing in, around bottom edge of pan. Fill in center with more triangles, then cut additional pieces to fill in any remaining spaces. Spread half of ice cream over cake. Freeze until firm, about 1 hour.",
            "Spread half of fudge topping over ice cream. Sprinkle with half of chopped candy. Repeat layering with remaining cake, ice cream, fudge topping and candy, freezing after adding ice cream. Cover tightly and freeze until ice cream is set, about 30 minutes. (Can be prepared up to 2 days ahead.)",
            "Remove pan sides. Place cake on platter. Spread some of whipped cream over sides of cake. Spoon remaining cream into pastry bag fitted with medium star tip. Pipe cream in rosettes around upper edge of cake."
