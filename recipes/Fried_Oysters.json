        "ingredients": [
            "1 1/2 cups bleached all-purpose, high-gluten flour",
            "10 ounces cold water",
            "3/4 teaspoon salt",
            "2 tablespoons baking powder",
            "2 tablespoons peanut oil",
            "5 cups peanut oil",
            "20 medium-size fresh oysters, opened, removed from shells, patted dry, dusted with flour"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Combine all batter ingredients in a bowl and reserve. Heat wok over high heat for 1 minute. Pour in peanut oil, heat to 375\u00b0F. Dip each oyster into the batter until well coated. When a wisp of white smoke appears, lower oysters into oil. Deep-fry 5 at a time until light brown, about 3 minutes. Remove oysters, place in strainer, drain over a bowl. Deep-fry last batch to a golden brown, about 4 minutes. Place cooked oysters back in oil for 2 minutes more so they become golden brown. During frying, always control heat. You may need to lower if oysters brown too much, or raise if they cook too slowly.",
