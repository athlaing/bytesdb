            "Put oven rack in middle position and preheat oven to 400\u00b0F. Soak raisins in very hot water to cover in a small bowl 30 minutes, replacing hot water once or twice as it becomes tepid. Tear cabbage into large pieces. Heat oil in a 12-inch heavy ovenproof skillet or pot over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking, then add cabbage in 5 batches, adding some salt and pepper with each batch, stirring, and adding next batch as previous batch begins to wilt. (Some cabbage will brown.) Add butter and thyme and cook, stirring frequently, until all cabbage is wilted, about 3 minutes. Drain raisins and add to cabbage, then transfer skillet to oven and roast, stirring every 10 minutes, until cabbage is tender, 30 to 40 minutes. Discard thyme sprigs before serving.",
