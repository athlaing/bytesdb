        "ingredients": [
            "1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour",
            "1 1/3 cups slivered almonds",
            "1 3/4 teaspoons ground cinnamon",
            "1/2 teaspoons fine sea salt",
            "2/3 cup sugar",
            "1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, room temperature",
            "1 large egg",
            "2 teaspoons dark rum",
            "1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract",
            "1/2 cup seedless raspberry jam",
            "Powdered sugar (for dusting)",
            "A 2\" star cookie cutter; a 1/2\" star cookie cutter"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Pulse flour, almonds, cinnamon, and salt in a food processor until almonds are finely ground (no larger than poppy seeds).",
            "Using an electric mixer at medium speed, beat sugar and butter in a large bowl until fluffy, about 3 minutes. Add egg; beat until well blended, about 1 minute. Beat in rum and vanilla. Reduce speed to low; add dry ingredients. Beat dough just to blend; gently knead if necessary to form a ball.",
            "Divide dough in half. Place each half between sheets of parchment or waxed paper. Working with 1 piece at a time, flatten dough into a disk; roll dough, occasionally lifting paper on both sides for easier rolling, until 1/8\" thick. Chill dough in paper until very firm, at least 2 hours. DO AHEAD: Dough can be made 2 days ahead. Cover; keep chilled.",
            "Arrange a rack in middle of oven and preheat to 375\u00b0F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats.",
            "Working with 1 dough disk at a time, remove top sheet of paper and, using 2\" star cookie cutter, cut out cookies. Transfer to baking sheets, placing 1/2\" apart; chill. Repeat with remaining dough. Gather scraps; repeat rolling, chilling, and cutting until dough is used.",
            "Using 1/2\" star cookie cutter, cut out a star from the center of half the cookies. Working in batches, bake cookies until light golden brown, dry, and just firm to the touch, 11-13 minutes. (Cookies will firm up as they cool.) Transfer to a wire rack; let cool. DO AHEAD: Cookies can be baked 2 days ahead. Store airtight at room temperature.",
            "Bring jam and 1 teaspoon water to a boil in a small saucepan; let cool slightly.",
            "Arrange whole cookies flat side up. Spoon 1 teaspoon cooled jam in the center of each, dabbing slightly to spread. Arrange cookies with cutouts flat side down on a wire rack; dust with powdered sugar. Set atop whole cookies, lining up star points and allowing jam to push up slightly through center. DO AHEAD: Linzer Stars can be assembled 8 hours ahead. Store airtight at room temperature."
