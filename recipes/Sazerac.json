            "1 cube or 1/2 teaspoon sugar",
            "4 dashes Peychaud Bitters",
            "Splash water, about 1/2 teaspoon",
            "2 ounces rye whiskey",
            "Splash Herbsaint (or Pernod), about 1/2 teaspoon",
            "Lemon peel for garnish",
            "Ice"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "In old-fashioned glass, add ice and set aside. In another, combine sugar, bitters, and water. Muddle until sugar is completely dissolved. Add rye whiskey, fill with ice, and stir well, about 15 seconds. From first glass, discard ice, then add Herbsaint. Holding glass horizontally, turn it so that Herbsaint completely coats the interior. Discard any excess. Strain contents of second glass into chilled glass. Twist lemon peel directly over drink to release essential oils, and serve."
