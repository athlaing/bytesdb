            "2 pounds New York strip steak (about 3 [1\"-thick] steaks)",
            "1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt, divided, plus more",
            "1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, plus more",
            "1 pineapple, peeled, cut into 1/2\" rounds, center core removed, divided",

        "instructions": [
            "Season steak with 1 tsp. salt and 1 tsp. pepper. Let sit at room temperature at least 1 hour.",
            "Meanwhile, pur\u00e9e 1 pineapple round, 1/2 tsp. salt, and 2 Tbsp. water in a blender until smooth. Add 3 Tbsp. oil and blend until smooth; set aside.",
            "Prepare a grill for medium-high heat or heat a grill pan over medium-high; oil grate or pan. Grill steaks and remaining pineapple rounds, turning occasionally, until pineapple is lightly charred and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of steak registers 120\u00b0F, 8\u201310 minutes for medium-rare (pineapple may take longer to cook than steak). Transfer steak to a cutting board. Let sit at least 15 minutes, then thinly slice. Transfer pineapple to a platter and tent with foil to keep warm.",
