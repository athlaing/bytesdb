Whisk 1 1/2 cups rye whiskey (bourbon or other whiskey will do, too), 3/4 cup honey, 1/4 cup mild-flavored (light) molasses, 1 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes, and 1/2 teaspoons coarsely ground black pepper in a medium bowl. Set one 12\u201314-pound cured smoked bone-in ham (skin removed if needed) on a rack in a large roasting pan and pour in 2 cups water. Score fat in a crosshatch pattern. Brush ham with rye whiskey mixture and roast, basting every 20 minutes with pan juices and tenting with foil if browning too quickly, until an instant-read thermometer inserted into thickest part of ham registers 135\u00b0F, 1 1/2\u20132 hours. Transfer ham to a cutting board and let rest 10 minutes before slicing. Serve with pan juices.",
