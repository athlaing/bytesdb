Set 2 sheets on a work surface; top each with a remaining sheet of foil (you are making 2 double-layer packets). Divide tomatoes, garlic, rosemary, and nduja between sheets, placing in the center. Season halibut generously with salt and pepper and set on top. Drizzle with wine and oil. Bring opposite sides of foil together in the center; crimp tightly, pressing out air, to close.",

Let rest at room temperature a few minutes, then carefully open and transfer fish to a platter. Top with tomatoes and cooking juices from packets.",
