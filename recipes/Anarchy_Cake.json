        "ingredients": [
            "1 1/2 cups fruit (or 4 ounces of chopped bittersweet chocolate), sliced if using peaches, apricots, or plums (neatness does not count); if using cherries, pit them",
            "3/4 cup of cake or pastry flour (all-purpose flour works in a pinch)",
            "3/4 teaspoon baking powder",
            "Pinch of salt",
            "1 egg",
            "1/2 cup superfine sugar, plus an additional 2 tablespoons",
            "1/4 teaspoon finely grated lemon zest",
            "1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil",
            "1/4 cup milk",
            "1/2 teaspoon balsamic vinegar"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Preheat oven to 350\u00b0F.",
            "Line bottom of a 10-inch-diameter springform pan with parchment paper, brush with oil, and lightly flour.",
            "Gently toss prepared fruit with 1 tablespoon of sugar and set aside. (If using chocolate, do not toss it with the sugar, just put aside until needed.)",
            "Combine flour, baking powder, and salt in a bowl and set aside.",
            "Using an electric mixer, beat the egg with the 1/2 cup of superfine sugar and lemon zest until light, fluffy, and pale in color. This could take as long as 5 minutes.",
            "Add the olive oil, then the milk and balsamic vinegar, beating until fully combined.",
            "Using a rubber spatula, fold in the flour mixture.",
            "Pour batter into the prepared springform pan and drop the sliced fruit over the top. Sprinkle with a tablespoon of sugar.",
            "Bake for 50 minutes, until the top is a beautiful golden brown. A knife blade inserted into the cake\u2019s center should come out clean."
