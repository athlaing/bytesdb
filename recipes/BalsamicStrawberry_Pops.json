        "ingredients": [
            "2 cups sliced, hulled strawberries (from about 1 pound berries)",
            "1/4 cup sugar",
            "2 1/2 tablespoons good-quality balsamic vinegar",
            "Freshly ground black pepper"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Place the strawberries and sugar in a food processor and pulse just until the mixture is finely chopped and juicy but still chunky; you don't want a smooth pur\u00e9e. Transfer to a bowl and stir in the balsamic vinegar and a few grinds of pepper. Spoon the mixture into ice pop molds and insert sticks. Freeze until firm, at least 6 hours or up to 1 week. To unmold the pops, run hot water over the outsides of the molds for a few seconds, then gently pull the sticks.",
