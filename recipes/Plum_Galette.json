            "Pastry dough for a single-crust pie",
            "2 tablespoons semolina flour",
            "8 tablespoons granulated sugar",
            "5 large black or red plums (1 1/2 lb), halved, pitted, and each cut lengthwise into 8 wedges",
            "1 tablespoon confectioners sugar",
            "3/4 cup crme frache or sour cream",
            "1 tablespoon Armagnac or Cognac (optional)",
            "parchment paper"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Put oven rack in middle position and preheat oven to 375\u00b0F. Line a large (17- by 12-inch) baking sheet with parchment paper.",
            "Roll out dough on a lightly floured surface with a lightly floured rolling pin into a 13-inch round. Transfer to baking sheet.",
            "Stir together semolina flour and 2 tablespoons granulated sugar and spread evenly over dough, leaving a 1-inch border. Arrange plums, skin sides down, in 1 layer on top of sugar mixture, then sprinkle plums with 3 tablespoons granulated sugar. Fold in edge of dough to cover outer rim of plums, pleating dough as necessary.",
            "Bake galette, loosely covered with a sheet of foil, 40 minutes. Remove foil and bake until fruit is tender and juices are bubbling, about 5 minutes more.",
            "Transfer galette on baking sheet to a rack and immediately brush hot juices over plums using a pastry brush. Dust hot galette with confectioners sugar (sugar will melt and help glaze galette). Cool to warm or room temperature, about 30 minutes.",
            "While galette cools, stir together crme frache, Armagnac (if using), and remaining 3 tablespoons granulated sugar in a bowl until sugar is dissolved. Serve galette with Armagnac cream."
