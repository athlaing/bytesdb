        "ingredients": [
            "2 teaspoons olive oil",
            "1 medium yellow onion, thinly sliced",
            "3 cloves garlic, minced",
            "1/4 cup fine dry plain bread crumbs (see Notes)",
            "1/4 cup sherry",
            "2 tablespoons fresh thyme",
            "1/2 teaspoon salt",
            "Several pinches of freshly ground black pepper",
            "1 1/2 cups vegetable broth",
            "1 (15-ounce) can white beans, rinsed and drained (1 1/2 cups)",
            "2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice"

        "instructions": [
            "Preheat a large pan over medium-high heat and add the oil. Saut\u00e9 the onion in the oil for 7 to 10 minutes, until lightly caramelized. Add the garlic and cook until fragrant, about 15 seconds. Add the bread crumbs and toss to coat the onions. Now let the bread crumbs toast, tossing occasionally, for about 2 minutes, or until they are a few shades darker. Add the sherry and mix so that the bread crumbs absorb the sherry. Cook for about 1 minute. Add the thyme, salt, black pepper, and broth. Mix well, cover the pan, and turn the heat up to a boil. Once boiling, uncover the pan, lower the heat, and let the gravy simmer, bubble, and reduce. Once it's thickened to a gravy consistency, add the white beans and heat through. Add the lemon juice and taste for seasoning. Serve hot.",
