        "ingredients": [
            "3/4 cup whole milk",
            "1 1/4-ounces envelope active dry yeast",
            "1 teaspoon sugar",
            "3 1/2 cups all-purpose flour plus more for surface and hands",
            "1 teaspoon kosher salt plus more",
            "1 small onion, finely chopped",
            "1 cup whole-milk yogurt (not Greek)",
            "2 tablespoons melted ghee (clarified butter) or vegetable oil plus more"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Heat milk in a small saucepan over medium-low heat until an instant-read thermometer registers 100\u00b0F. Transfer to a small bowl and whisk in yeast and sugar. Let stand until foamy, about 10 minutes.",
            "Whisk 3 1/2 cups flour and 1 teaspoon salt in a large bowl to blend. Add yeast mixture, onion, yogurt, and 2 tablespoons ghee. Mix dough until blended but still shaggy.",
            "Transfer dough to a lightly floured work surface. Knead until a smooth dough forms, adding flour as needed (dough will be sticky), about 5 minutes. Lightly grease another large bowl with ghee, place dough in bowl, and turn to coat. Cover with plastic wrap. Let rise in a warm, draft-free area until doubled in size, about 1 hour.",
            "Punch down dough and divide into 10 pieces. Using floured hands, roll each piece into a ball on a lightly floured surface. Cover with plastic wrap; let rest 10 minutes.",
            "Heat a large cast-iron or other heavy skillet over medium-high heat. Lightly coat with ghee. Working with 1 piece at a time, stretch dough with your hands or roll out with a rolling pin to 1/8\" thickness. Sprinkle with salt. Cook until lightly blistered, puffed, and cooked through, about 2 minutes per side. Wrap in foil to keep warm until ready to serve.",
            "DO AHEAD: Naan dough can be made 4 hours before shaping. Cover and chill."
