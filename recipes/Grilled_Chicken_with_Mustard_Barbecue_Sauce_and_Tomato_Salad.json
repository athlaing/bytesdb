        "instructions": [
            "Prepare a grill for 2-zone heat (for a charcoal grill, bank two-thirds of coals over one side of grill and scatter remaining coals over the other side; for a gas grill, set one burner to medium-high heat and the remaining burners to medium-low heat). Clean and lightly oil grate. Mix vinegar, brown sugar, honey, Worcestershire, garlic powder, paprika, cayenne, and 1/2 cup mustard in a medium bowl; set aside. Season chicken on all sides with 2 Tbsp. plus 2 tsp. salt. Grill chicken skin side down over direct heat, turning halfway through or whenever there is a flare, until lightly charred, 5-8 minutes. Move chicken to cooler part of grill, cover with lid, and continue to grill, turning several times and keeping covered, until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the breast registers 140\u00b0F, 15\u201320 minutes. The smaller pieces will go more quickly ,and you can transfer them to a rimmed baking sheet until all pieces are ready. Uncover grill and return any pieces from baking sheet back to grill. Using a brush, generously baste chicken with reserved sauce. Continue to grill, turning every 1\u20132 minutes and basting the other side, until the internal temperature of thickest part of breast registers 155\u00b0F and sauce is shiny and lacquered, about 6 minutes. Transfer chicken to a cutting board as pieces are done (again, the smaller pieces will go more quickly). Let rest 10 minutes before separating drumsticks from thighs and slicing chicken breast in half on a bias. While chicken rests, gently toss onions, 2 Tbsp. oil, and 1 tsp. salt in a medium bowl, being careful not to break up onion rounds into rings. Grill over medium-low heat, turning once, until charred on both sides and tender, 10\u201315 minutes. Whisk 2 Tbsp. bean pickling liquid and remaining 2 Tbsp. mustard in a large bowl. Drain beans and add to bowl. Add tomatoes and grilled onions. Toss to combine; season with salt. Arrange chicken on a large platter and serve with salad alongside. Do Ahead: Sauce can be made 3 days ahead. Cover and chill.",
