            "Preheat oven to 425\u00b0F. Whisk sour cream and 3 tablespoonss heavy cream in a small bowl.",

            "Transfer mixture to a large bowl. Using a spoon, mix in sour cream mixture, then gently knead a few times just until a shaggy dough comes together (a light hand is key to tender biscuits, so be careful not to overmix).",

            "Place biscuits on a parchment-lined baking sheet and brush with remaining 1 tablespoon heavy cream; sprinkle with sea salt and more pepper. Bake until golden brown on the tops and bottoms, 15\u201320 minutes. Serve warm with Salt-and-Pepper Butter, if desired.",
            "DO AHEAD: Dough can be made and cut out 6 hours ahead. Cover and chill. Biscuits can be baked 2 hours ahead. Reheat before serving, if desired."
