Add snap peas, garlic, and 1/4 cup water; sprinkle with salt. Saut\u00e9 until vegetables are just tender and water evaporates, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in 1 rounded tablespoon pistou. Transfer vegetables to platter; tent with foil to keep warm. Reserve skillet (do not clean). Heat remaining 1 tablespoon oil in reserved skillet over medium-high heat.
