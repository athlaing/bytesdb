        "title": "Wheat-Berry Stuffing with Pearl Onions ",
        "ingredients": [
            "12 slices country-style white bread",
            "2 cups wheat berries",
            "2 pounds pearl onions (see note, above)",
            "1 stick (1/2 cup) unsalted butter",
            "1 cup packed fresh flat-leafed parsley leaves",
            "1 1/2 cups chicken broth"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Preheat oven to 350\u00b0F. Cut bread into 1/2-inch pieces and in a large shallow baking pan toast in one layer in middle of oven until just dry, about 15 minutes. Croutons may be made 1 day ahead and kept, covered, at room temperature. In a 4-quart kettle three fourths full of boiling water (do not salt water) cook wheat berries, uncovered, until tender, about 1 hour, and drain in a large sieve. Transfer wheat berries to a large shallow baking dish. While wheat berries are cooking, in a large saucepan of boiling water blanch onions 3 minutes. Drain onions and when cool enough to handle, peel. In a large skillet melt butter over moderately high heat and saut\u00e9 onions, stirring occasionally, until golden, 15 to 20 minutes. Chop parsley and add with onions to wheat berries. Wheat-berry mixture may be made 1 day ahead and chilled, covered. Bring mixture to room temperature before proceeding. Add croutons and broth to wheat-berry mixture and toss to combine well. Bake stuffing in middle of oven, uncovered, 30 minutes, or until top is slightly crisp.",
