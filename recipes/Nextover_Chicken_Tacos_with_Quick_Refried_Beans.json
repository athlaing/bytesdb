        "title": "\"Nextover\" Chicken Tacos with Quick Refried Beans ",
        "ingredients": [
            "4 cooked chicken thighs from Crispy Chicken and Potatoes With Cabbage Slaw or about 2 cups shredded chicken",
            "1 cup good-quality tomatillo salsa",
            "2 tablespoons vegetable oil",
            "1 garlic clove, pressed or finely chopped",
            "1 1/4 cups cooked or 1 (15-ounce) can low-sodium black beans, drained",
            "1/4 tsp. kosher salt",
            "4 corn tortillas",
            "1 avocado, sliced",
            "1/2 cup leftover slaw from Crispy Chicken and Potatoes With Cabbage Slaw, optional",
            "Chopped cilantro, lime wedges, and hot sauce (for serving)"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Pull meat from chicken; discard skin. Warm chicken and salsa in a large skillet over medium-low heat until heated through. Meanwhile, heat oil in a medium skillet over medium. Cook garlic, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 1 minute. Add beans, salt, and 1/2 cup water and cook, stirring and crushing beans with the back of a large spoon, until warmed through and creamy, about 3 minutes. Let sit until ready to use. Working one at a time, warm tortillas with tongs directly over a gas burner, turning often, until lightly charred and puffed in spots, about 1 minute per side. (Alternatively, wrap tortillas in foil and heat in a 350\u00b0F oven until warmed through, or wrap in damp paper towels and microwave in 20-second bursts until warm.) Transfer to a plate and cover with a kitchen towel to keep warm. Fill tortillas with chicken and top with avocado, slaw, and cilantro. Serve with lime wedges, hot sauce, and refried beans alongside.",
