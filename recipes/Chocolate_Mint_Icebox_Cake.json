        "ingredients": [
            "1/3 cup loosely packed fresh mint leaves, rinsed, spun dry, and chopped fine, plus, if desired, mint sprigs for garnish",
            "3 tablespoons sugar",
            "1 tablespoon unsweetened cocoa powder",
            "1 cup heavy cream, chilled",
            "a 9-ounce package chocolate wafers"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "In a bowl of an electric mixer combine the mint leaves, the sugar, the cocoa powder, and the cream, beat the mixture until it holds soft peaks, and spread about 1 mounded teaspoon of it on one side of each wafer. On a platter sandwich the wafers together on their sides to form a log and ice the log with the remaining cream mixture, covering it completely. Chill the cake, covered loosely with plastic wrap, for at least 6 hours or overnight. Cut the cake diagonally into 3/4-inch-thick slices and serve it garnished with the mint sprigs."
