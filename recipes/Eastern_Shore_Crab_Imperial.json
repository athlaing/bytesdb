        "ingredients": [
            "1 pound lump crabmeat, bits of shell and cartilage removed",
            "2 slices firm-textured white bread",
            "2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted",
            "2 tablespoons curly parsley leaves, rinsed and wrung dry in paper toweling",
            "1/2 teaspoon salt",
            "1/8 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper",
            "Pinch ground hot red pepper (cayenne)",
            "2/3 cup mayonnaise (use light, if you like)",
            "1/2 teaspoon dry mustard"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "1. Preheat the oven to 400\u00b0F. Lightly coat 6 large scallop shellswith nonstick cooking spray or, if you prefer, lightly coat a 6-cup au gratin pan or shallow casserole; set aside. Place the crab in a medium-size mixing bowl and set aside also.",
            "2. Tear the bread into small chunks, letting them drop into a mini food processor fitted with the metal chopping blade. Using 3 to 4 brisk pulses, reduce to moderately coarse crumbs. Drizzle the melted butter over all and pulse 2 to 3 times to incorporate. The crumbs should now be moderately fine. Tip onto a piece of wax paper and reserve.",
            "3. Add the parsley, salt, black pepper, and cayenne to the processor (no need to wash the bowl or blade), and pulse briskly 3 to 5 times until the parsley is coarsely chopped.",
            "4. Add the mayonnaise and mustard and churn until smooth, about 5 seconds. Scoop on top of the crab and toss lightly to mix.",
            "5. Mound the crab mixture in the scallop shells or spread evenly in the augratin dish, and scatter the buttered crumbs on top.",
            "6. Bake uncovered on the middle oven rack until bubbling and touched with brown, 12 to 15 minutes.",
            "7. Serve at once, accompanying with a tartly dressed salad of greens. Roasted asparagus spears also make a delicious accompaniment."
