            "8 garlic cloves, thinly sliced",
            "1/3 cup grapeseed or vegetable oil",
            "Kosher salt",
            "1 (2\") piece ginger, peeled, finely chopped",
            "1 large egg, beaten to blend",
            "3 cups chilled cooked short-grain rice",
            "2 tsp. toasted sesame oil",
            "4 scallions, thinly sliced on a diagonal",
            "3/4 cup coarsely chopped cilantro",
            "2 tsp. toasted sesame seeds"

        "instructions": [
            "Toss garlic and grapeseed oil in a large nonstick skillet. Arrange garlic in a single layer and set over medium heat. Cook, shaking pan often, until garlic is barely golden and crisp (oil should stop bubbling at this point), about 5 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer garlic chips to paper towels to drain; season with salt. Increase heat to medium-high and cook ginger in oil in the same skillet, stirring occasionally, until just softened and fragrant, about 2 minutes. Add egg and stir to break up; cook until just set (this will take a matter of seconds). Add rice and sesame oil and toss to combine. Cook, undisturbed, pressing down on rice with a spatula so it makes good contact with the pan, until rice begins to crisp, about 2 minutes. Give rice a toss, then press down on it again, cooking until you get more crispy bits, about 2 minutes. Remove skillet from heat and toss in scallions and half of garlic chips; season with salt. Transfer fried rice to a platter and scatter cilantro, sesame seeds, and remaining garlic chips on top.",
