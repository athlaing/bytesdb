            "1/2 small shallot, finely chopped",

            "1/3 cup mascarpone",
            "1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh chives",
            "Kosher salt",
            "Vegetable oil (for frying; about 4 cups)",
            "1 cup all-purpose flour",
            "1/3 cup cornstarch",
            "1 tablespoon baking powder",
            "1/2 teaspoons kosher salt plus more",

            "Combine shallot, crabmeat, mascarpone, and chives in a medium bowl; season with salt. Gently fold to combine. Set aside.",
            "For batter and frying: Pour oil into a large saucepan fitted with a deep-fry thermometer to a depth of 6\". Heat oil over medium-high heat until thermometer registers 375\u00b0F. Meanwhile, whisk flour, cornstarch, baking powder, and 1/2 teaspoons salt in a large bowl. Gradually whisk in beer, just to blend (batter will be thick). Working in batches of about 4 and returning oil to 375\u00b0F between batches, measure 1 heaping tablespoon crab mixture, roll into a ball, and drop into batter. Using a fork, toss to coat and lift from batter, letting excess drip back into bowl. Carefully lower beignets into oil. Fry, turning occasionally, until crisp and deep golden brown, about 4 minutes. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate and season with salt. DO AHEAD: Crab mixture can be made 4 hours ahead. Cover and chill.",
