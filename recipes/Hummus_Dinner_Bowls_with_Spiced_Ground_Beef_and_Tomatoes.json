            "Heat oil in a large heavy, preferably cast-iron, skillet over high. Pat beef dry with paper towels, then press into an even layer in skillet with a spatula. Season with coriander, pepper, cinnamon, and 1 tsp. salt and cook, undisturbed, until a brown crust begins to form underneath, about 6 minutes. Turn, break beef into pieces, and continue to cook, stirring, until just cooked through, about 1 minute.",

Spoon spiced beef and tomato mixture over, then drizzle with oil and sprinkle with Aleppo-style pepper, if using. Serve with lemon wedges, hot sauce, pickles, and pita alongside, if using."
