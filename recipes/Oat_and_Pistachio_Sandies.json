        "ingredients": [
            "1 cup all-purpose flour",
            "1 cup old-fashioned oats",
            "1 cup raw pistachios",
            "3/4 teaspoon kosher salt",
            "1/2 teaspoon baking soda",
            "1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, room temperature",
            "1/3 cup granulated sugar",
            "1/4 cup powdered sugar"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Pulse flour, oats, pistachios, salt, and baking soda in a food processor to combine (small pieces of oats and pistachio should still be visible).",
            "Using an electric mixer on medium-high speed, beat butter, granulated sugar, and powdered sugar in a medium bowl to create air pockets in butter, about 5 minutes; mixture will look light and fluffy. Reduce speed to low and add dry ingredients, mixing just until blended. Divide dough between 2 sheets of plastic wrap or parchment paper and shape into about 1 1/2\"-diameter logs. Chill until firm, at least 1 hour. (The colder your dough, the easier it will be to cut into even slices.)",
            "Place racks in lower and upper thirds of oven; preheat to 350\u00b0. Using a serrated knife, slice logs into 1/4\"-thick rounds and place on parchment-lined baking sheets, spacing about 1/2\" apart. Bake, rotating baking sheets once, until cookies are golden brown around the edges, 10\u201312 minutes. Transfer to wire racks; let cool.",
            "Do ahead: Keep dough chilled up to 5 days, or freeze up to 1 month."
