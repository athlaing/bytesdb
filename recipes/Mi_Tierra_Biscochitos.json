            "6 cups well-sifted flour",
            "3 teaspoons baking powder",
            "1 teaspoon salt",
            "1 1/2 cups sugar, plus 1/4 cup mixed with 1 tablespoon cinnamon, on a plate",
            "2 teaspoons anise seed",
            "1 pound lard",
            "2 eggs, beaten",
            "1/2 cup brandy or sweet wine"

        "instructions": [
            "Put the flour, baking powder, salt, the 1 1/2 cups sugar, and the anise seed in the bowl of an electric mixer and blend at low speed. Add the lard in small batches, increasing the mixer speed to medium until the lard is well incorporated. Reduce the speed to low and add the beaten eggs and the brandy.",
            "Cover the mixing bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 24 hours.",
            "When ready to bake the cookies, preheat the oven to 350\u00b0F. Form the dough into Ping-Pong-ball-sized pieces. Place 12 balls on each of four cookie sheets. Dip a fork in dry flour and press the balls twice to form a crisscross pattern. The resulting cookie should be only about 1/4 inch high. Bake for 12 minutes or until the edges and bottoms are golden brown.",
