            "1 fresh poblano chile",
            "1 Fresno chile or red jalape\u00f1o",
            "1 medium onion, sliced into 1/4\"-thick rounds",
            "4 tablespoons vegetable oil, divided",
            "3 cups (packed) fris\u00e9e",
            "3 tablespoons balsamic vinegar",

        "instructions": [
            "Preheat broiler. Line a rimmed baking sheet with foil. Season steak with salt and pepper; set aside.",
            "Place chiles and onion on prepared sheet and brush with 2 tablespoons oil. Broil vegetables, turning once, until charred and soft, about 8 minutes. Transfer chiles and onion to a medium bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Let vegetables steam in covered bowl for 10 minutes.",
            "Meanwhile, line a platter with the fris\u00e8e. Heat remaining 2 tablespoons oil in a large cast-iron or other heavy skillet over medium-high heat. Add steak to skillet and cook, turning once, until browned and cooked to desired doneness, about 10 minutes for medium-rare. Transfer steak to fris\u00e9e-lined platter; let rest. The heat from the steak will wilt the greens slightly.",
            "Peel chiles. Cut in half and remove seeds; cut out core. Finely chop chiles and onion and transfer to a small bowl. Add vinegar and honey to chiles and stir to coat well. Season salsa to taste with salt.",
            "Transfer steak to a work surface and thinly slice crosswise against the grain. Return sliced steak to platter, arranging over wilted fris\u00e9e, and spoon charred pepper salsa over."
