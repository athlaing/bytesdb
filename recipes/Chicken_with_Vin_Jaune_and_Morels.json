            "3/4 ounces dried morel mushrooms",
            "1 cup boiling-hot water",
            "1 large shallot, thinly sliced",
            "2 garlic cloves, smashed",
            "1 tablespoon unsalted butter",
            "1 cup heavy cream",
            "1 whole chicken (about 3 1/2 pound), cut into 8 pieces",

        "instructions": [
            "Soak morels in boiling-hot water for 2 hours. Squeeze liquid from morels into remaining soaking liquid (set morels aside), then strain soaking liquid through a paper-towel-lined sieve into a bowl and reserve 1/2 cup. Cook shallot and garlic in butter with 1/4 teaspoon salt in a small heavy saucepan over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally, until tender and golden brown, about 3 minutes. Add cream and reserved soaking liquid and boil until reduced to about 3/4 cup, about 8 minutes. Meanwhile, pat chicken dry and sprinkle with 3/4 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper. Heat oil in a 12-inch heavy skillet over medium-high heat until it shimmers, then brown chicken in 2 batches, skin sides down first and turning once, until golden brown, about 6 minutes per batch. Transfer to a plate as browned. Return chicken to skillet, skin sides up, with any juices from plate and add morels, reduced cream mixture, and 3/4 cup vin jaune. Cook at a bare simmer, covered, over low heat until tender, about 45 minutes. Transfer chicken and morels to a serving dish and keep warm, loosely covered with foil. Boil sauce until slightly thickened and reduced to about 1 1/4 cups, about 5 minutes. Pour sauce over chicken and morels and sprinkle with a little more vin jaune.",
