            "Trim carrot tops, keeping 1/2-inch of the green tops attached if they are bright green and fresh. Peel and thinly slice the carrots lengthwise. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil and blanch the carrots for about 1 minute until they are slightly cooked but still a bit crunchy. Shock in an ice bath and drain when cool. Pat dry with paper towels.",

            "Place coriander, anise, cinnamon, honey, oil, lemon, and 1/2 teaspoon salt in a blender and blend until slightly chunky but seeds are not intact.",
            "To serve, toss carrots, currants, pistachios and dressing together in a large bowl. Be sure to coat the carrots with the dressing. Add herbs and carefully toss to combine. Serve immediately."
