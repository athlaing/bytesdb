            "Arrange a rack in middle of oven; place pizza stone or inverted (if rimmed) baking sheet on rack. Preheat to 425\u00b0F.",
            "Working in batches if needed, pulse cauliflower in a food processor fitted with the blade, or grate using the medium holes of a box grater, until fine crumbs form and are rice-like in texture. Transfer to a clean kitchen towel and tightly squeeze to remove as much liquid as possible.",

Using a rolling pin, make thickness as even as possible. Carefully slide parchment onto preheated pizza stone or baking sheet.",
            "Bake cauliflower crust until golden brown and firm to the touch, rotating halfway through, 20\u201322 minutes.",
            "Remove from oven. Sprinkle with 1 1/4 cups mozzarella. Top with sauce, using the back of a spoon to spread over cheese. Sprinkle with remaining 1/4 cup mozzarella.",
            "Slide pizza back onto pizza stone or baking sheet and continue to bake until bubbly and browned in spots, 5\u20137 minutes. Top with basil and red pepper, if using. Let sit 5 minutes, then cut into 6\u20138 wedges.",
