            "1 1/4 pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs, trimmed",
            "6 ounces button mushrooms, trimmed, coarsely chopped",
            "2 limes",
            "1/2 cup Greek-style plain full- or low-fat yogurt",
            "3 tablespoons coarsely chopped cilantro, plus whole leaves for serving",
            "2 medium carrots (about 4 ounces each), peeled",
            "1 medium mango, thinly sliced",
            "5 ounces baby spinach (about 4 packed cups)",

            "Preheat oven to 425\u00b0F. Stir cumin, 3 Tbsp. oil, 1 tsp. salt, and 1/2 tsp. pepper in a large bowl. Add chicken and mushrooms and toss to coat. Spread on a rimmed baking sheet and roast until an instant-read thermometer inserted into thickest part of thigh registers 165\u00b0F, 15\u201317 minutes. Meanwhile, juice limes to yield 6 Tbsp. juice. Blend yogurt, 3 Tbsp. lime juice, and 3 Tbsp. cilantro in a blender until smooth. Shave carrots with a vegetable peeler lengthwise into ribbons (or use the large holes of a box grater). Whisk 1 Tbsp. oil and remaining 3 Tbsp. lime juice, 1/4 tsp. salt, and 1/4 tsp. pepper in a large bowl. Add carrots and mango; toss gently to coat. Remove baking sheet from oven, arrange spinach over chicken, and continue to roast until spinach is wilted, about 2 minutes. Transfer chicken to a cutting board, leaving spinach on sheet, and thinly slice. Arrange tortillas on a work surface. Dividing evenly, layer cheese, chicken, mushrooms, and spinach on one side of each tortilla. Fold tortillas in half to create half-moons. Heat 1 1/2 tsp. oil in a large heavy skillet over medium-low until hot. Cook 2 quesadillas, turning once, until cheese is melted and tortillas are browned, 1\u20132 minutes per side. Transfer quesadillas to serving plates, then cook remaining quesadillas with remaining 1 1/2 tsp. oil. Sprinkle quesadillas with cilantro leaves and serve with yogurt sauce and carrot-mango slaw alongside.",
