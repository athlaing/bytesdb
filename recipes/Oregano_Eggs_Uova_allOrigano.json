        "ingredients": [
            "2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil",
            "8 large eggs",
            "1/4 teaspoon kosher salt",
            "1/2 teaspoon dried oregano",
            "1/4 cup grated Grana Padano or Parmigiano-Reggiano"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Set a large (12-inch) nonstick skillet over a burner that's still off. Swirl the pan with the olive oil, and gently break all the eggs to fill the pan, taking care not to break the yolks. Sprinkle with the salt and dried oregano. Sprinkle the grated cheese over all.",
            "Cover the skillet, and turn the flame to medium-low. Cook until the whites are set and the yolks are done to your liking, about 7 to 8 minutes for still-runny yolks.",
            "This is a great breakfast or main course, or, served over some arugula, it can be an appetizer."
