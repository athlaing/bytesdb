        "ingredients": [
            "4 garlic cloves, finely chopped; plus 2 heads, halved crosswise",
            "1 tablespoon coarsely chopped fresh rosemary, plus 4 sprigs",
            "1 tablespoon fennel seeds, coarsely chopped",
            "1 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt",
            "2 tablespoons olive oil, divided",
            "Freshly ground black pepper",
            "1 1 1/2-pound pork tenderloin",
            "4 slices bacon"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Preheat oven to 425\u00b0. Toss chopped garlic, chopped rosemary, fennel seeds, salt, and 1 tablespoon oil in a small bowl; season with pepper.",
            "Rub garlic mixture all over tenderloin (if you have time to do this in the morning, great; refrigerate pork until dinner). Scatter rosemary sprigs in a large baking dish and set tenderloin on top. Wrap bacon slices around tenderloin, tucking ends underneath so bacon stays put. Nestle halved heads of garlic around tenderloin and drizzle everything with remaining 1 tablespoon oil.",
            "Roast until an instant-read thermometer inserted into thickest part of tenderloin registers 145\u00b0 for medium, 40\u201345 minutes. Transfer to a cutting board and let rest at least 10 minutes before slicing."
