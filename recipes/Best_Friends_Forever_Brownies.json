        "ingredients": [
            "3 ounces unsweetened chocolate (100 percent cacao), chopped",
            "1 1/2 sticks (12 tablespoons) unsalted butter, cut into pieces",
            "1 1/2 cups sugar",
            "3 large eggs",
            "1 1/2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract",
            "1/2 teaspoon salt (if you have fine sea salt, use it)",
            "1/2 cup all-purpose flour",
            "1/4 cup unsweetened cocoa (any type, as long as it's unsweetened)",
            "3/4 cup walnuts, chopped",
            "8-inch square baking pan"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Heat oven to 325\u00b0F with rack in middle. Lightly grease or butter pan and line with crisscrossed sheets of parchment or foil, leaving a 1-inch overhang. Melt chocolate with butter in a large metal bowl set over a pan of simmering water, stirring occasionally, until smooth. Remove bowl from pan and let cool 5 minutes. Add sugar and whisk well. Add eggs, 1 at a time, whisking well after each addition, and whisk mixture vigorously until smooth and cohesive. Whisk in vanilla and salt. Add flour and cocoa and stir with whisk until incorporated and batter is smooth. Fold in nuts with a rubber spatula. Spread batter evenly in pan and bake until a wooden pick comes out clean, about 40 minutes. Cool brownies completely in pan on a rack. To remove them easily from the pan, use the parchment overhangs to lift the brownies, still on the parchment, from the pan. Cut brownies into serving pieces.",
