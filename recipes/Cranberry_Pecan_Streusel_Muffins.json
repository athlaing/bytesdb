        "instructions": [
            "Position rack in center of the oven. Preheat oven to 400\u00b0F and bake 20 to 22 minutes. Prepare the pan as directed.",
            "In a medium bowl, toss together all streusel topping ingredients and pinch everything together with your fingertips to make crumbs. Set aside.",
            "Measure the sugar. In another bowl, toss together the cranberries and nuts with the grated orange zest, extract, and 1 tablespoon of sugar. Set aside.",
            "In a large bowl, whisk together the egg(s), yogurt or milk, melted butter or oil, the remaining sugar, and the wheat germ. Place a sifter over the bowl and measure the flour, baking powder, baking soda (if using), salt, and cinnamon into it. Stir/sift the dry ingredients onto the wet, add the cranberry-nut mixture, and stir everything together just to blend; don't over-beat.",
            "Divide the batter evenly among the muffin cups, filling them nearly full. Sprinkle generously with the streusel crumbs. (Half-fill any empty cups with water.) Bake 20 to 22 minutes (or for the time indicated for your altitude in the chart), or until the muffins are golden brown and well risen and a cake tester inserted in the center comes out clean. Cool slightly on a wire rack, and serve warm."
