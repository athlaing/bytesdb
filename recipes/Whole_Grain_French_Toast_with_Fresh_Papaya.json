        "ingredients": [
            "1 medium papaya",
            "1/2 cup milk",
            "1 large egg",
            "1 tablespoon sugar",
            "1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract",
            "Pinch salt",
            "4 slices whole grain bread (1/2 to 3/4 inch thick)",
            "1/2 tablespoon unsalted butter, plus additional, if necessary",
            "Maple syrup, for serving, optional"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "1. Peel the papaya and cut it in half lengthwise. Use a spoon to remove the seeds. Slice the papaya into cubes (you should have about 1 cup).",
            "2. In a large shallow bowl whisk together the milk, egg, sugar, vanilla, and salt. Dip each slice of bread into the egg mixture, soaking both sides so that the bread is well coated and has absorbed the custard.",
            "3. Melt the butter in a large pan over medium-high heat. Add the bread and cook, working in batches, if necessary, until golden brown, about 2 minutes per side. Add additional butter to the pan if the bread seems to be sticking.",
            "4. Transfer the French toast to two serving plates and drizzle with maple syrup, if desired. Top with the chopped papaya and serve."
