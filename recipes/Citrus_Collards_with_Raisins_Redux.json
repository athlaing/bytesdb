        "ingredients": [
            "2 large bunches collard greens, ribs removed, cut into a chiffonade, rinsed and drained",
            "1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil",
            "2 cloves garlic, minced",
            "2/3 cup raisins",
            "1/3 cup freshly squeezed orange juice"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "In a large pot over high heat, bring 3 quarts of water to a boil and add 1 tablespoon salt. Add the collards and cook, uncovered, for 8 to 10 minutes, until softened. Meanwhile, prepare a large bowl of ice water to cool the collards.",
            "Remove the collards from the heat, drain, and plunge them into the bowl of cold water to stop cooking and set the color of the greens. Drain by gently pressing the greens against a colander.",
            "In a medium-size saut\u00e9 pan, combine the olive oil and the garlic and raise the heat to medium. Saut\u00e9 for 1 minute. Add the collards, raisins, and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Saut\u00e9 for 3 minutes, stirring frequently.",
            "Add orange juice and cook for an additional 15 seconds. Do not overcook (collards should be bright green). Season with additional salt to taste if needed and serve immediately. (This also makes a tasty filling for quesadillas.)"
