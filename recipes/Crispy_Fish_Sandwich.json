            "Combine onion, pickles, and pickle brine in a small bowl. Mix mayonnaise, dill, hot sauce, pepper, 2 tsp. lemon juice, and 1/2 tsp. salt in another small bowl. Place eggs, panko, and flour in 3 separate shallow medium bowls. Season each fish fillet with 1/2 tsp. salt. Working one at a time, dredge fish in flour, shaking off excess. Coat evenly with egg, allowing excess to drip back into bowl. Coat with panko, pressing to adhere. Transfer fish to a plate. Heat oil in a large skillet over medium. Cook fish until breading is golden brown and cooked through, 2\u20133 minutes per side. Transfer fish to a paper towel-lined plate. Season fillets with 1/2 tsp. salt total. Spread 1 heaping Tbsp. mayonnaise mixture on one side of each slice of bread. Pile each bottom slice with 3/4 cup lettuce, 1 fish fillet, a small handful of potato chips, and 1/4 cup onion mixture. Close sandwich with second slice of bread, mayo side down, and push down lightly to crush potato chips. Transfer to a platter. Repeat with remaining sandwiches. Serve with lemon wedges and more potato chips alongside. Do Ahead: Pickled onions and dill sauce can be made 1 day ahead. Cover and chill.",
