        "title": "Whole Grilled Fish with Lime ",
        "ingredients": [
            "1 5-pound, two 2 1/2-pound, or three 1 1/2-pound head-on fish, such as gray or pink snapper, black sea bass, or branzino, scaled, gutted",
            "Kosher salt",
            "1/4 cup olive oil plus more for oiling and drizzling",
            "2 limes or 5 Key limes (preferably from Mexico), thinly sliced",
            "1/4 cup fresh lime juice",
            "1/2 bunch each basil and cilantro, stems and leaves separated"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Build a medium-hot fire in a charcoal grill, or heat a gas grill to medium-high. Score fish: Cut 1 slash lengthwise down to the bone, then crosswise in 2 places, spacing apart; repeat on other side. Season fish cavity and skin with salt; drizzle fish with 1/4 cup oil. Stuff some of the lime slices (reserve a few for garnish) and herb stems inside fish.",
            "Clean and oil grill grate well. Grill fish, resisting the urge to turn it, until skin is nicely crisp and charred and flesh is flaky and opaque down to the bone. (This can take 6-15 minutes, depending on size of fish. Don't mess around with it until it's ready.) Place a metal spatula underneath fish (a pair of metal tongs on top of fish also helps for support), then lift and gently roll over to the other side. Cook until flesh is flaky and opaque down to the bone, 6-15 minutes. Use a small knife to check for doneness; if it slides easily through the thickest part of flesh, fish is done. If not, finish cooking fish on grill or in a 450\u00b0F oven.",
            "Place fish on a serving platter; drizzle oil and lime juice over. Garnish with reserved lime slices, basil leaves, and cilantro."
