        "instructions": [
            "Preheat oven to 350\u00b0F. Toast pecans on a rimmed baking sheet, tossing once, until slightly darkened and fragrant, 6\u20138 minutes. Let cool, then coarsely chop. Cook wild rice in a large pot of boiling salted water until most of the grains have split and all are tender, 40\u201350 minutes; drain and rinse under cold running water. Shake off as much water as possible and let cool. Meanwhile, whisk vinegar, orange juice, and honey in a large bowl to combine. Add garlic and let sit 10 minutes to infuse. Fish out garlic; discard. Add rice and toss to coat. Heat 1/4 cup oil in a large skillet over medium-high. Cook leeks, stirring occasionally, until tender and browned in spots, 8\u201310 minutes. Season with salt and transfer to bowl with rice; toss to coat. Wipe out skillet and heat another 1/4 cup oil over medium-high until just beginning to smoke. Arrange mushrooms in skillet in a single layer and cook, undisturbed, until undersides are golden brown, about 2 minutes. Season with salt and pepper, toss, and continue to cook, tossing often and reducing heat as needed to avoid scorching, until golden brown all over, about 3 minutes longer. Mix in thyme and immediately transfer to bowl with rice. Add pecans and chives and drizzle with more oil; toss once more.",
