            "1 (7-ounce) can Italian tuna in oil, undrained (or chunk light tuna in water, drained and mixed with 1 tablespoon olive oil)",
            "1 (6-ounce) jar marinated artichoke hearts, undrained",
            "Zest and juice of 1 lemon",
            "Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper to taste",
            "1/2 thin 18-inch baguette, sliced lengthwise, interior crumb removed",
            "6 to 8 whole basil leaves"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "1. In a medium bowl, combine the first four ingredients.",
            "2. Fill the baguette with the mixture, scatter the basil leaves on top.",
            "3. Close the baguette and wrap it tightly in waxed paper, then in aluminum foil.",
            "4. Place the sandwich at the bottom of the cooler so the weight of the other contents compresses the sandwich and allows the juices to soak into the bread."
