        "ingredients": [
            "1/2 cup mirin (sweet rice wine) or dry sherry",
            "1/2 cup soy sauce, preferably reduced-sodium",
            "1/2 cup chicken broth",
            "1 tablespoon finely grated or minced fresh ginger",
            "1 teaspoon pressed or minced garlic",
            "3/4 pound sirloin or tri\u2013tip steak",
            "8 green onions, trimmed to 4 inches from root end",
            "2 teaspoons toasted sesame seeds"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "To make the marinade, combine the mirin, soy sauce, chicken broth, ginger, and garlic in a small saucepan. Bring to a boil and simmer for 1 minute. Pour the marinade into a shallow dish large enough to hold the meat and set aside to cool.",
            "Cut the beef into 24 (1\u2013inch) squares about 1/2 inch thick. Add the beef to the cooled marinade, stir to evenly coat, and refrigerate for at least 1 hour, stirring occasionally. Cut the trimmed green onions into thirds. Soak 12 (4\u2013 to 6\u2013inch) bamboo skewers in water for at least 1 hour.",
            "Preheat an outdoor grill.",
            "Thread 2 pieces of beef and green onion, alternating, onto one end of each skewer. Grill the skewers until the meat is nicely browned and just a bit pink in the center, about 2 minutes per side. Transfer the skewers to a plate or small platter and sprinkle with the sesame seeds. Set the plate on a warming tray to keep warm, if you wish."
