        "instructions": [
            "Pulse almonds, flour, baking powder, salt, and spices in a food processor until nuts are very finely ground.",
            "Beat together butter and sugar with an electric mixer until pale and fluffy, then beat in egg. Add flour mixture in 2 batches, mixing at low speed just until a dough forms. Form dough into a disk and chill, wrapped in plastic wrap, until firm, at least 2 hours.",
            "Whisk together brown sugar, eggs, molasses, salt, and spices. Whisk in pumpkin, then cream.",
            "Assemble and bake tart: Preheat oven to 375\u00b0F. Roll out dough on a lightly floured surface with a floured rolling pin into a 12-inch round. (Dough will be sticky, so rotate frequently and dust surface with flour as needed.) Slide bottom of tart pan under dough and set into rim of tart pan. Press dough against side of pan and trim excess. (Dough cracks easily but can be patched.) Line shell with foil and fill with pie weights. Bake in lower third of oven until dough is set and pale golden, 15 to 20 minutes. Carefully remove foil and weights, then add custard, spreading evenly. Sprinkle top with pine nuts and bake until filling is set, 30 to 35 minutes. (If edge of crust is browning too quickly, cover edge with foil or a piecrust shield.) Cool completely in pan on a rack. Remove rim of tart pan, leaving tart on pan bottom, and transfer to a platter.",
