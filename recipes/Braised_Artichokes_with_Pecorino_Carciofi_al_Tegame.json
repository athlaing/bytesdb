        "ingredients": [
            "2 pounds small artichokes",
            "1 lemon for acidulated water",
            "1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil",
            "4 garlic cloves, sliced",
            "2 cups chopped onion",
            "1/2 teaspoon coarse sea salt, or to taste",
            "1/2 teaspoon peperoncino flakes, or to taste",
            "1 cup shredded pecorino (6 to 8 months old) or mild Cheddar",
            "A heavy-bottomed skillet or saut\u00e9 pan, 12-inch diameter or larger, with a tight-fitting cover"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Trim the artichokes, slice very thinly, and soak the slices in acidulated water.",
            "Pour the olive oil into the skillet, and set it over medium heat. Scatter the garlic and onion in the pan. Cook for 4 minutes or so, stirring and tossing occasionally; season with the salt and peperoncino.",
            "When the vegetables are sizzling and wilting, lift the artichoke slices from the acidulated water, drain briefly, and drop them into the skillet. Stir well, cover the pan tightly, and let everything cook slowly, giving the pan a shake now and then.",
            "After 10 minutes, the artichoke slices should be softening\u2014if they're hard and the pan is dry, add a couple spoonfuls of acidulated water and continue cooking, covered. Braise for 15 to 20 minutes total, until the artichokes are tender and lightly colored. Cook uncovered for more caramelization if you like.",
            "Turn off the heat, and spread the artichokes out in the skillet bottom. Scatter the shredded cheese evenly on top, and cover the pan. Let it melt into the vegetables for several minutes before serving."
