            "6 oz/170g fiddlehead ferns (optional)",
            "1 Tbsp olive oil",
            "2 cloves garlic, minced",
            "1/2 yellow onion, minced",
            "2 cups/400g arborio or carnaroli rice",
            "1 cup/240ml dry white wine",
            "1 cup/240ml plus 1 qt/960ml chicken stock (homemade or store-bought), hot",
            "2 tsp sea salt, plus more",
            "Ground black pepper",

            "1/3 cup/85g store-bought basil pesto"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Bring a large pot of generously salted water to a boil. Prepare a bowl of ice water. Add the asparagus to the pot and blanch, just until bright green, about 1 minute. Using a slotted spoon, transfer to the ice water to stop the cooking, about 30 seconds. Transfer the asparagus to a colander to drain. Repeat with the English peas, sugar snap peas, and fiddleheads.",
            "Heat the oil in a large saut\u00e9 pan over medium heat. Add the garlic and onion and saut\u00e9 just until translucent, about 30 seconds. Add the rice and stir until opaque, about 1 minute.",
            "Stir the wine into the rice, bring to a simmer, and cook, stirring periodically, until the rice absorbs the wine, about 5 minutes. Stir in 1 cup/240ml stock and 2 teaspoons salt, return to a simmer, and let cook until the liquid has been absorbed. Spread the rice mixture on a baking sheet and set aside until you are ready to finish the dish, or skip this step and keep cooking, continuing with adding the hot stock.",
            "About 15 minutes before you\u2019re ready to serve, return the rice mixture to the saut\u00e9 pan and cook over medium heat. Stir 1 cup/240ml of the hot stock into the rice mixture and cook until the moisture has been nearly absorbed. Season with salt and pepper. Repeat for the remaining 3 cups/720ml of stock, adding 1 cup/240ml at a time. When you still see liquid pooling here and there in the pan, remove from the heat and stir in the blanched vegetables and the Parmesan. Quickly stir in the pesto and serve.",
            "Store risotto, covered, in the refrigerator for up to 2 days.",
            "Do Ahead To prepare the risotto ahead of time, cook the vegetables and the rice up until you add the wine and 1 cup/240ml of stock. Once the rice has absorbed the liquid, spread the rice and onion mixture on a baking sheet to hold until you\u2019re ready to finish cooking. Just before dinner, return the rice to the pot and resume cooking until done.",
