        "title": "Grilled Bone-In Rib Eye ",
        "ingredients": [
            "3 (2-inch) bone-in rib-eye steaks (about 2 pounds each)",
            "Kosher salt, freshly ground pepper",
            "Flaky sea salt (for serving)"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "The night before you plan to cook the steaks, pat dry with paper towels and put on a wire rack set inside a rimmed baking sheet. Season generously with salt and pepper and chill, uncovered, until about an hour before you want to cook your steaks. Pull steaks from the refrigerator and let sit on your counter at room temperature.",
            "Prepare a grill for medium-high, indirect heat (for a charcoal grill, bank coals on one side of grill; for a gas grill, leave one or two burners off). Grill steaks over direct heat, turning, until nicely charred, about 4 minutes per side. Move steaks over indirect heat and continue grilling, turning halfway through, until browned all over, about 4 minutes per side. Using tongs, hold a steak perpendicular to grill and sear bone side and fat-cap side of steak to render out some of the fat, about 2 minutes per side. Repeat with remaining steaks. Insert an instant-read thermometer into the thickest part of steaks; if it registers 120\u00b0F for rare (steaks will carry over to 125\u00b0F, or medium-rare, as they rest), they\u2019re done. Continue to cook over indirect heat if needed\u2014another 2\u20134 minutes should do it. Transfer to a cutting board; let rest 20 minutes before slicing against the grain.",
            "Arrange sliced steaks on a platter and sprinkle with sea salt."
