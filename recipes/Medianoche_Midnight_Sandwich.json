        "title": "Medianoche (Midnight Sandwich) ",
        "ingredients": [
            "4 large rolls Pan de Media Noche or sweet roll-like brioche or challah, sliced lengthwise",
            "4 tablespoons yellow mustard",
            "12 ounces sweet-cured ham, thickly sliced",
            "8 ounces Lech\u00f3n Asado, sliced, trimmed of any excess fat, and at room temperature",
            "4 ounces Swiss cheese (Emmentaler or Jarlsberg), thinly sliced",
            "2 large dill pickles, thinly sliced crosswise",
            "4 tablespoons butter, melted and cooled to room temperature, plus more for greasing"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Spread both sides of each roll with mustard. Layer the bottom half with ham, pork, and cheese to cover the bread from end to end. Top with sliced pickles to taste. Brush the outside of the bread, both top and bottom, with butter.",
            "Heat a sandwich press over medium heat. Lightly brush the inside of the press with additional butter. Press the sandwich until the cheese is melted and the meats are warm, 3 to 5 minutes.",
            "Alternately, heat a 12-inch cast-iron skillet over medium heat. Create a press by wrapping a brick, heavy skillet, or can of soup in aluminum foil. Place the sandwich in the skillet and press down on the sandwich, turning once, until it is warmed through and the outside crust is golden, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Repeat with the remaining sandwiches. Slice on the diagonal and serve."
