            "Butter for greasing ramekins",
            "6 large eggs",
            "1/4 teaspoon salt",
            "1/4 teaspoon black pepper",
            "1/8 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg",
            "1/8 teaspoon cream of tartar",
            "3 oz coarsely grated Cantal cheese (1 cup)",
            "6 tablespoons cr\u00e9me fra\u00eeche",
            "1 tablespoon chopped fresh chives",
            "6 (8-oz) ramekins or a 13- by 9- by 2-inch baking dish"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Put oven rack in middle position and preheat oven to 350\u00b0F. Butter ramekins or baking dish.",
            "Separate eggs, putting whites in a large bowl and carefully sliding whole, unbroken yolks into a small bowl of cold water.",
            "Beat whites with salt, pepper, nutmeg, and cream of tartar using an electric mixer at medium-high speed until they just hold stiff peaks. Fold in 1/2 cup cheese gently but thoroughly, then divide mixture among ramekins or transfer to baking dish, smoothing top slightly (whites will stand above rims of ramekins). Make an indentation in center of whites in each ramekin or make 6 evenly spaced indentations if using baking dish. Carefully remove yolks from water 1 at a time with your fingers and put 1 yolk in each indentation.",
            "Stir cr\u00e9me fra\u00eeche and spoon 1 tablespoon on top of each yolk, then sprinkle eggs with remaining cheese. Transfer ramekins (if using) to a large shallow baking pan.",
            "Bake until whites are puffed and pale golden (yolks will jiggle slightly), 10 to 14 minutes. Sprinkle with chives and serve immediately."
