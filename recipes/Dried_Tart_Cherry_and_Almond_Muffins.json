        "instructions": [
            "Position rack in center of oven and preheat to 375\u00b0F. Butter ten 1/3-cup metal muffin cups. Bring juice to simmer in small saucepan. Remove from heat. Add cherries; let stand until softened, about 10 minutes.",
            "Mix flour, sugar, baking powder and salt in medium bowl. Using electric mixer, beat almond paste and melted butter in large bowl until well blended (mixture will still have some small pieces of almond paste). Add eggs 1 at a time, beating well after each addition. Mix in cherry mixture and orange peel. Add flour mixture and mix just until blended.",
            "Divide batter among prepared muffin cups. Bake until tester inserted into center of muffins comes out clean but slightly moist to touch, about 20 minutes. (Can be prepared 2 days ahead. Cool. Wrap muffins in foil and store at room temperature. Rewarm in foil in 350\u00b0F oven 5 minutes.) Serve warm."
