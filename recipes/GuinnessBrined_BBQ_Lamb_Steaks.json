            "2 cups Guinness ale",
            "1 tablespoon coarse salt",
            "1/4 cup sugar",
            "1 cup water",
            "3 tablespoons Smokin' Rub",
            "3 pounds bone-in lamb leg steaks (see Know-How)",

            "Combine the Guinness, salt, sugar, water and 2 tablespoons spice rub in a 1-gallon zipper-lock bag. Drop in the lamb steaks, press out the air, and seal. Refrigerate for 2 to 6 hours. Light a grill for direct medium-high heat, about 425\u00b0F. Remove the lamb from the brine and pat dry. Discard the brine. Coat the lamb with the oil and season with the rub. Set aside for 10 minutes. Brush the grill grate and rub with oil. Grill the steaks for about 7 minutes per side for medium-rare (135\u00b0F on an instant-read thermometer). Baste with a thin layer of the sauce during the last minute of grilling. Rest the meat for 5 minutes before serving. Serve the steaks with the remaining sauce on the side.",
