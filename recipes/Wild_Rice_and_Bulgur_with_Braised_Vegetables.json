            "Bring 2 quarts water with 2 teaspoons salt to a boil in a 3-quart saucepan. Put bulgur in a large bowl, then pour half of boiling water over it and soak, uncovered, until tender, about 1 hour. Add wild rice to water remaining in pan and simmer, covered, until tender and grains are split open, 1 to 1 1/4 hours. Drain bulgur and wild rice together in a large colander. Wash leeks in a bowl of cold water, agitating leeks, then lift out and drain in a sieve. Melt butter in a 3- to 4-quart wide heavy saucepan over moderately low heat. Add leeks, onion, carrots, celery, and remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender, about 10 minutes. Stir in rice and bulgur and cook, covered, stirring occasionally, until heated through, 5 to 10 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.",
