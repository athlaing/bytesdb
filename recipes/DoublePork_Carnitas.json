Fry, stirring occasionally and pressing on pork with spoon to break up, until browned and just beginning to crisp, 10\u201315 minutes. Most of the pieces should be bite-size with some smaller shredded and super-crisp bits in the mix. Using a slotted spoon, transfer to a paper towel\u2013lined baking sheet. Cover with foil to keep warm and moist. Repeat with remaining pork.",
