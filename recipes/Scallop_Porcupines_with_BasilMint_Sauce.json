            "Stack phyllo sheets atop one another on work surface. Cut crosswise into 2-inch-wide strips. Stack strips atop one another; cut crosswise into 1/4-inch-wide strips. Place strips in medium bowl. Using fingers, toss strips to separate. Mix flour and curry powder in pie dish; add salt and pepper. Whisk egg to blend in small bowl. Coat scallops 1 at a time with flour mixture. Dip into egg, then into phyllo strips, coating completely. Place on plate.",
            "Preheat oven to 350\u00b0F. Pour enough oil into heavy medium saucepan to reach depth of 3 inches; heat to 350\u00b0F. Working in batches, deep-fry scallops just until coating is golden, about 25 seconds. Using slotted spoon, transfer scallops to baking sheet. Bake scallops just until opaque in center, about 6 minutes. Drain on paper towels. Divide Basil-Mint Sauce among 4 plates. Top each with 3 scallops."
