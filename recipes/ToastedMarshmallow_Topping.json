            "Stir corn syrup, 1 cup water, and sugar in medium saucepan over medium-high heat until sugar dissolves. Attach candy thermometer to side of pan. Boil syrup without stirring until thermometer registers 238\u00b0F, occasionally brushing down sides of pan with wet pastry brush, about 12 minutes.",

When thermometer in syrup registers 230\u00b0F, beat whites at medium-low speed until peaks form. When thermometer registers 238\u00b0F, pour hot syrup down sides of bowl, beating until marshmallow topping is shiny and thick, about 2 minutes.",
