            "Make bread puddings: Whisk together eggs, sugar, and salt in a large bowl, then whisk in milk, vanilla, and cinnamon. Place 2 slices of bread in each buttered muffin cup, then divide custard among cups. Let stand, gently pressing down on bread occasionally, until soft and some of custard is absorbed, about 30 minutes. Preheat oven to 350\u00b0F. Bake bread puddings in middle of oven until golden on top and a tester inserted in center comes out clean, 30 to 35 minutes. Transfer to a rack to cool slightly, about 5 minutes (puddings will sink slightly in center). Remove from pan, then cool on rack until warm, about 10 minutes more.",

            "Make sauce while puddings cool: Cut bananas crosswise into 1/3-inch-thick slices. Melt butter in a 1-quart heavy saucepan over moderate heat, then add brown sugar and cook, whisking, until smooth and combined well, about 1 minute. Add rum and bananas, then simmer, stirring occasionally, 2 minutes. Serve puddings warm with sauce spooned over them.",
