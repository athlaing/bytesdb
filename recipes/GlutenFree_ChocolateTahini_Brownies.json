            "3 tablespoons cornstarch",
            "2 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder",
            "6 ounces bittersweet or semisweet chocolate, coarsely chopped",
            "3 tablespoons virgin coconut oil",
            "4 tablespoons tahini, divided",
            "2 large eggs",
            "1/3 cup granulated sugar",
            "1/4 cup (packed) light brown sugar",

        "instructions": [
            "Preheat oven to 350\u00b0F. Line an 8x8\" baking dish with 2 overlapping pieces of parchment, leaving overhang. Whisk cornstarch and cocoa in a bowl until no lumps remain. Heat chocolate, oil, and 1 Tbsp. tahini in a small saucepan over low, stirring, until melted and smooth, about 1 minute; remove from heat. Using an electric mixer on medium-high speed, beat eggs and both sugars in a large bowl until light, smooth, and doubled in volume, about 4 minutes. Reduce speed to medium and beat in salt and vanilla. Scrape in chocolate mixture and beat to incorporate; beat in cornstarch mixture. Increase speed to medium-high and mix until batter is thick and stiff, about 1 minute. Scrape into prepared baking dish and smooth top. Stir agave nectar into remaining 3 Tbsp. tahini in a small bowl. Dollop spoonfuls over batter in 5 or 6 spots; drag a skewer or toothpick through to swirl. Bake brownies until edges are puffed, top is browned, and a tester inserted into the center comes out with a few moist crumbs attached, 22\u201326 minutes. Let cool. Remove from pan; cut into squares. Brownies can be baked 3 days ahead. Store tightly wrapped at room temperature.",
