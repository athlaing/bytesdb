            "1/2 cup all-purpose flour",
            "1/4 teaspoon salt",
            "1 large egg",
            "1/3 cup milk",
            "1/2 cup club soda or seltzer (from a new bottle)",
            "2 teaspoons vegetable oil",
            "1/2 teaspoon grated and peeled fresh gingerroot",
            "freshly ground black pepper to taste",
            "1/4 cup chopped fresh chives",
            "1/2 stick (1/4 cup) unsalted butter, melted"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "In a blender or food processor blend all cr\u00eape ingredients except chives and butter until smooth and transfer to a bowl. Let batter stand at room temperature, covered, 1 hour. Batter may be made 1 day ahead and chilled, covered.",
            "Add chives to batter and stir well. Heat a 6-inch non-stick skillet over moderate heat until hot. Brush skillet lightly with some butter and remove from heat. Half fill a 1/4-cup measure with batter and pour into skillet, tilting and rotating skillet quickly to cover bottom.",
            "Cook cr\u00eape until underside is golden and top appears almost dry, about 30 seconds. Turn cr\u00eape over with a thin spatula and cook until underside is golden, 15 to 20 seconds more. Slide cr\u00eape onto a kitchen towel and cool. Make more cr\u00eapes with remaining batter in same manner, brushing skillet lightly with butter for each cr\u00eape and stacking cooked cr\u00eapes on another kitchen towel after they cool. Cr\u00eapes may be made 1 day ahead and chilled, stacked between sheets of wax paper and wrapped well in plastic wrap. Bring cr\u00eapes to room temperature before using."
