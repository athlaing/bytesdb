            "1/2 cup whole-milk cottage cheese",
            "1/4 cup sour cream",
            "1/4 teaspoon salt",
            "1/4 teaspoon black pepper",
            "6 bacon slices (6 oz), cut crosswise into 1/2-inch pieces",

            "Cook bacon in a 10-inch skillet over moderate heat, stirring occasionally, until it just begins to brown, about 5 minutes. (Bacon should be tender, not crisp.) Remove from heat.",
