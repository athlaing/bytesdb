            "Prepare grill for medium-high heat. Mix onion, cilantro, lime juice, ginger, sugar, chopped mint, half of chiles, and 1/3 cup oil in a medium bowl; season with salt. Set relish aside.",
            "Season inside of fish with salt. Stuff with mint sprigs, lime slices, and remaining chiles; tie with kitchen twine. Drizzle with remaining 1 tablespoon oil; season with salt. Grill fish until skin is crisp and flesh is flaky and opaque down to the bone, about 5 minutes per side. (If a small knife slides easily through the thickest part of flesh, the fish is done.) Serve with relish.",
