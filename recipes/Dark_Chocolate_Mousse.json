        "title": "Dark Chocolate Mousse ",
        "ingredients": [
            "4 1/2 ounces bittersweet chocolate, finely chopped",
            "2 tablespoons (1 ounce) unsalted butter, diced",
            "2 tablespoons espresso or hot water",
            "1 cup cold heavy cream",
            "3 large eggs, separated",
            "1 tablespoon sugar"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Combine the chocolate, butter, and espresso in the top of a double boiler over hot, but not simmering, water, stirring frequently until smooth. Remove from the heat and let cool until the chocolate is just slightly warmer than body temperature. To test, dab some chocolate on your bottom lip. It should feel warm. If it is too cool, the mixture will seize when the other ingredients are added.",
            "Meanwhile, whip the cream to soft peaks, then refrigerate. Once the melted chocolate has cooled slightly, whip the egg whites in a medium bowl until they are foamy and beginning to hold a shape. Sprinkle in the sugar and beat until soft peaks form.",
            "When the chocolate has reached the proper temperature, stir in the yolks. Gently stir in about one-third of the whipped cream. Fold in half the whites just until incorporated, then fold in the remaining whites, and finally the remaining whipped cream.",
            "Spoon or pipe the mousse into a serving bowl or individual dishes. Refrigerate for at least 8 hours. (The mousse can be refrigerated for up to a day.)"
