        "ingredients": [
            "8 ears of unhusked corn",
            "1/2 cup cilantro leaves, large stems removed",
            "2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lime juice",
            "1 garlic clove, peeled, and grated on a Microplane grater",
            "1 teaspoon kosher salt",
            "1 teaspoon finely ground fresh black pepper",
            "1/4 cup canola or vegetable oil",
            "1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil",
            "4 limes, each cut into 4 to 6 wedges",
            "Fleur de sel",
            "16 tablespoons (8 ounces) unsalted butter, cut into pats"

        "instructions": [
            "1. Keeping the husks attached, peel them back in sections on each ear of corn, and remove the silk. Cover the exposed corn with the husk. Soak the corn in cold water for 5 to 10 minutes. 2. Preheat one grate of a well-oiled charcoal or gas grill to medium-high and another to high. 3. Place the cilantro, lime juice, garlic, salt, and pepper in a small food processor or in a blender and pulse to combine. With the machine running, slowly drizzle in the oils. Alternately the pesto can be combined by hand. Set aside. 4. Place the corn, still covered by the husk, on the medium-high grate. Cook for 3 minutes, turn to the other side, and cook for 3 minutes. Remove from the grill, peel back the husk, return to the high grate to mark and lightly char the corn on all sides, turning and jockeying between medium and high as need for 5 to 7 minutes total. 5. Remove the corn from the grill and brush generously with the pesto. Squeeze lime over the ears and sprinkle with fleur de sel. Serve with any remaining limes, and pats of butter on the side.",
