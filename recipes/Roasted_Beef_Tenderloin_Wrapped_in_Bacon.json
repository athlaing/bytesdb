            "Preheat oven to 450\u00b0F. Using small sharp knife, cut twelve 1-inch-deep slits all over beef tenderloin. Insert garlic slices into slits. Rub pepper all over tenderloin. Arrange bacon slices on work surface, overlapping slightly and forming rectangle. Place 1 rosemary branch down center of bacon rectangle, perpendicular to bacon slices. Place tenderloin atop rosemary branch. Place remaining 2 rosemary branches atop tenderloin. Wrap bacon slices around tenderloin and rosemary to enclose tenderloin completely. Place tenderloin in roasting pan, bacon ends down. (Can be assembled 1 day ahead. Cover and refrigerate.)",

            "Transfer tenderloin to cutting board. Reserve pan drippings for Broccoli Pancotto , if desired. Using large sharp knife, cut tenderloin through bacon and rosemary into 1/2-inch-thick slices and serve."
