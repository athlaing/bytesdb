        "title": "Escarole-Stuffed Pizza ",
        "ingredients": [
            "3 lb escarole (about 3 heads), tough outer ribs discarded and leaves thinly sliced (20 cups loosely packed)",
            "1 lb pizza dough at room temperature",
            "6 tablespoons olive oil",
            "5 garlic cloves, finely chopped",
            "10 oz chilled Italian Fontina, coarsely grated (2 cups)",
            "a 9-inch round metal cake pan (2 inches deep)"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Put oven rack in lowest position and preheat oven to 500\u00b0F. Lightly oil cake pan.",
            "Cook escarole in a 6- to 8-quart pot of boiling salted water, uncovered, until tender, 5 to 10 minutes. Drain in a colander, then immerse colander in a large bowl of ice water to stop cooking. Drain again and press gently to remove excess water. Transfer escarole to a large kitchen towel, then gather corners and twist tightly to wring out as much liquid as possible.",
            "Cut off one third of dough (keep remaining dough covered with plastic wrap) and pat into cake pan, covering bottom. Brush with 1 tablespoon oil and prick all over with a fork. Bake until golden, 8 to 10 minutes. Let crust stand in pan on a rack.",
            "Meanwhile, heat 1/4 cup oil in a 12-inch heavy skillet over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking, then saut\u00e9 garlic, stirring occasionally, until golden, about 30 seconds. Add escarole, 1/4 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper and saut\u00e9, stirring, until escarole is coated with oil, about 4 minutes. Transfer to a large shallow bowl to cool slightly, about 15 minutes, then stir in cheese.",
            "Spread escarole filling over crust in pan, leaving a 1/4-inch border around edge. Roll out remaining dough into a 10-inch round (on a lightly floured board if it sticks). Transfer to pan, covering filling and tucking edge under bottom crust to form a flat top and completely enclose filling (stretch dough if necessary). Press edges to seal. Brush top with remaining tablespoon oil and bake until golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes.",
            "Run a sharp thin knife around edge of pan. Invert a rack over pan and, wearing oven mitts and holding pan and rack firmly together, flip pizza onto rack. Turn pizza right side up and cool 15 minutes before serving. Slide pizza onto a cutting board and cut into wedges."
