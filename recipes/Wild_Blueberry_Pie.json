            "2 tablespoons cold vegetable shortening",
            "1/4 teaspoon salt",

            "1 cup sugar plus additional for sprinkling the pie",

            "1/2 teaspoon salt",

        "instructions": [
            "Preheat oven to 425\u00b0F. Roll out half the dough 1/8 inch thick on a lightly floured surface, fit it into a 9-inch (1 quart) pie plate, and trim the edge, leaving a 1/2-inch overhang. Chill the shell while making the filling. In a large bowl toss together well the blueberries, the cornstarch, 1 cup of the sugar, the lemon juice, the nutmeg, and the salt, mound the filling in the shell, and dot it with the butter.",
            "Roll out the remaining dough into a 13 to 14-inch round on the lightly floured surface, cut out a 1 1/2-inch star from the middle of the round, and drape the round over the filling. Trim the dough, leaving a 1-inch overhang, fold the overhang under the bottom crust, pressing the edge to seal it, and crimp the edge decoratively. Brush the crust with the half-and-half or milk, cut slits in the top crust around the crust, and sprinkle the pie lightly with the additional sugar. Bake the pie in the bottom third of the oven for 20 minutes, reduce the temperature to 375\u00b0F., and bake the pie for 30 to 35 minutes more, or until the crust is golden and the filling is bubbling. Transfer the pie to a rack and let it cool.",
            "To make the p\u00e2te bris\u00e9e: In a large bowl blend the flour, the butter, the vegetable shortening, and the salt until the mixture resembles meal. Add the 2 tablespoons ice water, toss the mixture until the water is incorporated, adding the additional ice water if necessary to form a dough, and form the dough into a ball. Dust the dough with flour and chill it, wrapped in wax paper, for 1 hour.",
