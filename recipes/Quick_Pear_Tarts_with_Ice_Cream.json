        "instructions": [
            "Preheat oven to 425\u00b0F. Roll out 1 pastry sheet on floured work surface to 1/8-inch thickness. Using 6-inch plate as aid, cut out 2 rounds. Repeat rolling and cutting with second pastry sheet, forming 4 rounds total. Place rounds on heavy large baking sheet, spacing apart. Using 1 pear half for each tart, fan out pear slices in center of each round. Brush tarts with melted butter; sprinkle each with 1 tablespoon sugar. Bake until pears are tender and pastry is golden, about 22 minutes. Transfer tarts to plates. Top each with ice cream and drizzle with brandy."
