            "Put oven rack in middle position and preheat oven to 350\u00b0F. Put liner on a baking sheet. Melt butter in a 1- to 2-quart heavy saucepan over moderately low heat and add honey, sugar, and corn syrup, stirring until combined. Remove from heat and stir in flour until incorporated, then stir in egg white. Working in batches of 6, spread small spoonfuls of batter with a small offset spatula or back of a spoon into long strips, about 1 inch wide and 5 to 6 inches long, on baking sheet, spacing cookies 2 inches apart. Top each batch with about 2 3/4 tablespoons almonds and sprinkle with sea salt. Bake until evenly golden, 9 to 10 minutes, then cool briefly on baking sheet to firm slightly, 1 to 2 minutes. Transfer with a thin metal spatula to a rack to cool completely. Transfer wafers as cooled to an airtight container.",
