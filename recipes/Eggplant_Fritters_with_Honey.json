        "ingredients": [
            "2 eggplants (about 1/4 pounds)",
            "About 2 cups milk",
            "Flour for dusting or dredging",
            "Salt",
            "Olive or sunflower oil for deep-frying",
            "Orange blossom honey or other aromatic runny honey"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Peel the eggplants and cut them into slices about 1/3 inch thick. Put them in a bowl, add enough milk to cover, and put a small plate on top to hold them down. Let soak for 1 to 2 hours; drain.",
            "Cover a plate with plenty of flour mixed with a sprinkling of salt. Working in batches, turn the eggplant slices in this so that they are entirely covered with flour, then shake them to remove the excess. Deep-fry in sizzling but not too hot oil, turning the slices over as soon as the first side is brown. Drain on paper towels.",
            "Serve hot with a dribble of honey, and let people help themselves to more honey if they like."
