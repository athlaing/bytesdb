        "ingredients": [
            "12 ounces fresh cranberries, washed",
            "1 cup sugar",
            "1 1/2 cups water",
            "Thinly sliced zest of 2 oranges (removed with a zester)",
            "8 to 12 3-inch springs fresh thyme, such as orange balsam, lemon, or English thyme(1/2 ounce)",
            "1 1/2 cups freshly squeezed orange juice"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Bring the cranberries, sugar, water, and orange zest to a boil in a medium (3-quart) saucepan. Partially cover the pan and boil until most of the cranberries pop, about 5 minutes. Stir in the thyme sprigs, remove from the heat, cover tightly, and steep for 30 minutes. Pour the fruit mixture into a fine sieve set on top of a deep bowl. Stir and press down on the fruit with the back of a large spoon to extract as much juice and pulp as you can, leaving the skins and thyme behind in the sieve. Refrigerate the strained mixture until thoroughly chilled. Stir in the orange juice. Freeze in an ice cream make according to the manufacturer's directions."
