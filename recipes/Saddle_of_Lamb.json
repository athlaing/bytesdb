        "ingredients": [
            "1 saddle of lamb (also known as the double loin or double rack), excess fat and long, flat flank sections removed, saddle rolled and tied",
            "Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper",
            "1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh rosemary",
            "Potatoes Anna (for serving)",
            "Lightly saut\u00e9ed zucchini (for serving)"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Preheat oven to 325\u00b0F. Rub lamb well with a little salt, pepper, and rosemary. Place on a rack and roast, allowing about 12 minutes per pound, until the internal temperature has reached 145\u00b0F. Salt again just before removing from the oven. Let stand for 10 minutes in a warm place before carving. Remove the strings which hold the roast together and with a sharp knife cut the meat in long, thinnish slices parallel to the spine. Run the point of the knife along the bone to loosen the slices. Repeat on the other side. Turn the roast over and remove the small filets on the underside. Slice them in rounds. Serve each person a long slice and one or two of the small slices from the filet, with some of the pan juices. Potatoes Anna and lightly saut\u00e9d zucchini are excellent with this. Drink a good red Chassagne-Montrachet.",
