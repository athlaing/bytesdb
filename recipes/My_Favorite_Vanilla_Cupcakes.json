            "175g (1 1/3 cups) all-purpose flour",
            "200g (about 1 cup) superfine sugar",
            "75g (5 1/4 Tbsp) butter",
            "1 1/2 tsp baking powder",
            "2 eggs, at room temperature",
            "90ml (1/3 cup) whole milk, at room temperature",
            "1 tsp vanilla bean paste",
            "Stand mixer, 12-hole cupcake tin, and paper cupcake cases."

        "instructions": [
            "Preheat the oven to 350\u00b0F/180\u00b0C/160\u00b0C fan/gas 4. Line the cupcake tin with 12 cupcake cases. In the bowl of a stand mixer, combine the flour, sugar, butter, and baking powder using the paddle attachment. Mix on a low speed until the mixture resembles fine breadcrumbs. You shouldn't see any large lumps of butter. Alternatively, use your fingers to rub the butter into the flour and sugar.",
            "In a small jug, use a fork to blend the eggs, milk, and vanilla bean paste together. Add the mixture a little at a time to the bowl, beating until it is all combined. Keep beating for a few minutes more, until the mixture is uniform and smooth with no lumps.",
            "Divide the mixture between the cases evenly, filling each one no more than two-thirds full. Bake in the preheated oven for 16\u201318 minutes, until a skewer inserted comes out clean and the cakes are a pale golden brown. Don\u2019t be tempted to over-bake here; get them out as soon as the skewer is clean. The last thing you want is dry cakes!",
            "Leave to cool for five minutes in the tin, then remove and leave to cool completely on a cooling rack. Do not attempt to core, fill or decorate them until they are cold."
