Working in batches if necessary, grill wings over medium heat, turning occasionally, until skin is starting to brown and fat is rendering, about 12 minutes. Move wings to medium-high zone of grill or increase heat under grill pan to medium-high. Cook wings, moving to a cooler section of grill or reducing heat if they start to burn, until cooked through, an instant-read thermometer inserted into the flesh but not touching the bone registers 165\u00b0F, and skin is crisp and lightly charred, 5\u201310 minutes.",
