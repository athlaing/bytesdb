            "1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour",
            "1/2 cup sugar",
            "1 teaspoon baking powder",
            "1/4 teaspoon salt",
            "1 stick (1/2 cup) cold unsalted butter, cut into 1/2-inch cubes",
            "1 large egg",
            "1 teaspoon vanilla",
            "1/2 cup sugar",
            "2 tablespoons all-purpose flour",
            "1 tablespoon quick-cooking tapioca",
            "2 lb firm-ripe large peaches (about 4), halved lengthwise, pitted, and each half cut lengthwise into fourths",
            "1 cup blueberries (1/2 pint)",
            "1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice",

        "instructions": [
            "Pulse together flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt in a food processor until combined. Add butter and pulse just until mixture resembles coarse meal with some small (roughly pea-size) butter lumps. Add egg and vanilla and pulse just until dough clumps and begins to form a ball, about 15 pulses.",
            "Press dough onto bottom and evenly (about 1/4 inch thick) all the way up side of springform pan with floured fingertips. Chill pastry in pan until firm, about 10 minutes.",
            "Make filling while pastry chills: Put oven rack in middle position and preheat oven to 375\u00b0F. Grind 2 tablespoons sugar with flour and tapioca in grinder until tapioca is powdery, then transfer to a large bowl and stir in remaining 6 tablespoons sugar. Add peaches, blueberries, and lemon juice and gently toss to coat. Spoon filling into pastry and bake, loosely covered with a sheet of foil, until filling is bubbling in center and crust is golden, about 1 3/4 hours. Transfer cake in pan to a rack and cool, uncovered, 20 minutes, then carefully remove side of pan. Cool cake to barely warm or room temperature, then cut into thick wedges with a sharp knife before serving.",
