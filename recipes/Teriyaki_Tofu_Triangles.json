        "ingredients": [
            "2 tablespoons reduced-sodium soy sauce",
            "1 tablespoon light olive oil",
            "1 teaspoon dark sesame oil",
            "1 tablespoon honey or maple syrup",
            "2 teaspoons rice vinegar or white wine vinegar",
            "1/2 teaspoon grated fresh ginger or a good pinch of ground ginger",
            "2 teaspoons hoisin sauce, optional",
            "One 16-ounce tub extra-firm tofu",
            "1 or 2 scallions, thinly sliced, optional"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "1. Combine all the ingredients for the marinade in a small bowl and stir together.",
            "2. Cut the tofu into 1/2-inch-thick slices. Blot well between clean tea towels or several layers of paper towels, then cut each slice through the thickness again to make 1/4-inch-thick slices. Blot briefly again.",
            "3. Cut each slice into 2 squares, then each square on the diagonal into 2 triangles. Place in a shallow pan and drizzle with the marinade. Gently turn the tofu pieces over so that both sides are coated with marinade. Let stand for 10 minutes or so.",
            "4. Heat a wide nonstick skillet. Transfer the tofu and marinade into the skillet. Cook over medium-high heat, stirring gently and frequently, until the tofu is nicely browned on most sides.",
            "Scatter scallions over the tofu if desired, and serve at once."
