            "Cut leeks into 1/4\" rounds. Rinse, tossing with hands so that leeks separate into individual rings, and drain thoroughly. Transfer to a medium pot. Add oil and toss to coat. Cover pot and cook over medium heat until leeks begin to soften, 5\u20136 minutes. Add potatoes, 1 tsp. kosher salt, and 1 1/2 tsp. pepper and stir to combine. Add clam juice, bay leaves, and 2 cups water and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and cook, uncovered, until potatoes are fork-tender, 10\u201312 minutes.",
            "Season halibut with remaining 1 tsp. kosher salt. Add to pot along with cream and peas and stir to combine. Cook, stirring occasionally, until halibut is opaque, 3\u20134 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in lemon juice.",
            "Divide chowder among bowls. Top with pea shoots, basil, and lemon zest. Season with sea salt and a generous amount of pepper."
