Whisk together flour, salt, and pepper in a shallow bowl. Whisk together eggs with a pinch of salt in another shallow bowl and put bread crumbs in a third shallow bowl. Working with 1 medallion at a time, dredge medallions in flour, shaking off excess, and dip in egg, letting excess drip off, then coat with crumbs, pressing to help them adhere. Arrange pork in 1 layer on a baking sheet. Heat 1/4 inch oil in a 12-inch heavy skillet over moderate heat until hot but not smoking, then panfry medallions, turning over once, until golden brown, 6 to 8 minutes total. Transfer to a clean baking sheet and roast in oven until thermometer inserted horizontally into center of meat registers 145 to 150\u00b0F, 6 to 7 minutes.",
