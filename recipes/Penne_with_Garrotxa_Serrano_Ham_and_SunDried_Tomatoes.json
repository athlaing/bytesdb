        "ingredients": [
            "8 ounces penne",
            "1 pound Garrotxa, shredded",
            "1/4 cup milk",
            "1/2 cup cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche",
            "1 tablespoon butter",
            "1/2 teaspoon freshly ground white pepper",
            "1/3 cup chopped sun-dried tomatoes",
            "6 ounces serrano ham slices, torn coarsely by hand into chunks"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "1. Preheat oven to 375\u00b0F.",
            "2. Cook the pasta in salted boiling water until al dente. Drain through a colander. Set aside.",
            "3. In a saucepan, combine cheese, milk, cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche, and butter. Cook over medium-low heat until cheese is mostly melted and you have a creamy sauce. To keep the cheese sauce from breaking, remove the sauce from the heat before the cheese is entirely melted. Season with pepper, adding more to taste if you like.",
            "4. In a shallow buttered casserole dish, toss pasta with sun-dried tomatoes and Serrano ham. Pour the sauce over the pasta, then stir together until combined. Bake for 15 to 20 minutes, until the top is golden brown and bubbling around the edges. Serve immediately."
