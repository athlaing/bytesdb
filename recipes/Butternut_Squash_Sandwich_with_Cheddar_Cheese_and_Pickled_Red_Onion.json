            "Arrange racks in middle and upper thirds of oven; preheat to 450\u00b0F. Cut squash in half crosswise where the neck and body meet. Peel and seed. Slice neck lengthwise into 1/4\"-thick planks (about 2 1/2\" long). Slice body into 1/4\" pieces. Divide squash, oil, thyme, garlic, 1 tsp. salt, and 1/2 tsp. pepper between 2 rimmed baking sheets. Toss to combine, then arrange in a single layer. Bake, tossing once halfway through and rotating trays, until squash is tender, 18\u201320 minutes. Meanwhile, bring vinegar, sugar, remaining 3/4 tsp. salt, and 1/2 cup water to a boil in a small saucepan. Remove from heat, then stir in onion. Let cool. Whisk mayonnaise and mustard in a small bowl. Remove thyme leaves from stems, then finely chop leaves and garlic. Stir into mayonnaise mixture. Slice rolls in half and toast in oven 5 minutes. Spread 2 Tbsp. mayonnaise mixture on bottom halves. Top each with squash, cheese, 1 1/2 Tbsp. pickled red onion, and arugula. Serve with chips alongside, if using.",
