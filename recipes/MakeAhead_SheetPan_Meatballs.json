            "Place bread in a large bowl, pour milk over, and let sit until moistened, about 5 minutes. Squeeze bread with your hands to remove excess milk; discard milk. Tear bread into pea-size pieces and return to bowl.",
            "Add beef, sausage, eggs, Parmesan, and salt to bread. Using your hands, gently mix until evenly distributed (do not overmix).",
            "To serve immediately: Arrange racks in upper and lower thirds of oven; preheat to 500\u00b0F. Lightly coat three 18x13\" rimmed baking sheets with oil. Fill a small bowl with cool water. Moisten your hands and roll meat mixture between palms into ping pong\u2013size balls (about 1.5\" diameter; 1.2 oz. each), occasionally moistening hands as needed. Arrange meatballs 1/2\" apart on prepared sheets. Roast meatballs, rotating racks top to bottom once halfway through, until lightly browned and cooked through, 8\u201310 minutes.",
