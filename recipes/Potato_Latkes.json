        "title": "Potato Latkes ",
        "ingredients": [
            "2 pounds large russet (baking) potatoes (about 4)",
            "2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice",
            "1 large onion (1 pound)",
            "1/2 cup all-purpose flour",
            "3 large eggs, lightly beaten",
            "1 cup vegetable oil"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Preheat oven to 250\u00b0F with rack in upper third.",
            "Peel potatoes and coarsely grate into a bowl using large teardrop-shaped holes of a box grater or in a food processor fitted with medium shredding disk. Add lemon juice and toss to coat.",
            "Coarsely grate onion into same bowl. Transfer to a kitchen towel (not terry cloth), then gather up corners to form a sack and twist tightly to wring out as much liquid as possible.",
            "Wipe bowl clean, then return potatoes and onion to bowl and stir in flour, eggs, and 1 1/4 teaspoons salt until just combined.",
            "Heat oil in a 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until hot but not smoking. Fill a 1/4-cup measure halfway with latke mixture and carefully spoon it into skillet, then flatten to 3 inches in diameter with a slotted spatula.",
            "Form 5 more latkes in skillet and fry until undersides are deep golden, 1 1/2 to 3 minutes. (If latkes brown too quickly, reduce heat to medium.) Turn over and fry until deep golden all over, 1 1/2 to 3 minutes more. Transfer to paper towels to drain briefly, then transfer to a metal rack set in a baking pan and keep warm in oven. Make more latkes."
