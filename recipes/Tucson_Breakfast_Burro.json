            "1 1/2 tbsp vegetable oil",
            "1/2 medium onion, chopped",
            "1 red or green bell pepper, seeded, cored and chopped",
            "1 1/2 lb thickly sliced lean deli roast beef, cut into matchsticks (or a 15-oz can black or pinto beans, drained, for machaca for a nonmeat protein)",
            "3/4 cup lowfat, low-sodium chicken, beef or vegetable broth",
            "2 cups bottled tomato salsa",
            "1 cinnamon stick",

        "instructions": [
            "To make machaca, heat oil in a skillet on medium heat. Add onion and pepper and saut\u00e9 about 3 minutes. Stir in meat and continue saut\u00e9ing until meat is brown and crispy but not burned. (Scrape meat from the bottom occasionally.) Stir in broth and 1/2 cup salsa and add cinnamon stick. Bring mixture to a boil. Reduce to medium and cook until most of the liquid evaporates but the meat remains moist. Salt to taste. Remove cinnamon stick. Mix eggs into machaca and continue cooking 1 or 2 minutes until eggs are just firm. Spoon 1/6 mixture onto each tortilla and roll up. Place on a plate and spoon remaining salsa over each burro."
