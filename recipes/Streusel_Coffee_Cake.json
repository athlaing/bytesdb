Cut in 1/4 cup chilled butter using fingers or pastry blender until mixture resembles coarse meal. Set streusel mixture aside. Sift flour, baking powder, baking soda and nutmeg into large bowl. Using electronic mixer, cream 3/4 cup butter and 1 1/3 cups sugar together in another large bowl until fluffy. Add eggs 1 at a time, beating well after each addition. Mix in vanilla.

Bake until golden brown and toothpick inserted into centers comes out clean, about 55 minutes. Cool on rack. Serve warm or at room temperature.",
