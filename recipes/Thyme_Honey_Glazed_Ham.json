        "title": "Thyme Honey Glazed Ham ",
        "ingredients": [
            "3 tablespoons unsalted butter",
            "2 tablespoons chopped thyme",
            "1 (12-to 14-pounds) boneless or semiboneless fully cooked ham at room temperature 1 hour",
            "1/4 cup cider vinegar",
            "1/2 cup mild honey",
            "1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Melt butter with thyme and let stand until ready to use.",
            "Preheat oven to 350\u00b0F with rack in lower third.",
            "Peel off and discard any rind or skin from ham, leaving 1/4 inch of fat on ham. Score fat on top of ham in a crosshatch pattern without cutting into meat. Put ham on a rack in a large roasting pan. Cover ham with parchment paper, then cover roasting pan with foil. Bake 1 3/4 hours.",
            "Meanwhile, boil vinegar in a small saucepan until reduced to about 1 tablespoon. Remove from heat and whisk in honey, Worcestershire sauce, and thyme butter. Let honey glaze stand until ham has baked 1 3/4 hours.",
            "Discard foil and parchment from ham. If there is no liquid in roasting pan, add 1 cup water (liquid will prevent glaze from burning in pan). Brush ham with half of honey glaze, then bake, uncovered, 30 minutes.",
            "Brush with remaining glaze and bake until glaze is deep golden-brown and ham is heated through, about 30 minutes more."
