        "instructions": [
            "Whisk together the vinegar, lime juice, garlic, chipotle, cumin, oregano, salt, pepper, and cloves in a medium bowl. Set aside.",
            "Press Saut\u00e9 and use the Saut\u00e9 or Adjust button to select the highest temperature (\u201cMore\u201d). Place the vegetable oil in the inner pot. Wait until the display reads \u201cHot,\u201d about 5 minutes, then add the beef. Cook with the lid off, turning the beef every 2 minutes, until the beef is browned on most sides, about 8 minutes.",
            "Add the vinegar sauce and the chicken broth (be careful\u2014steam may whoosh up!), and then the bay leaves. Stir to combine.",
            "Close and lock the lid. Set the valve to Sealing. Press Cancel, then press Manual or Pressure Cook and use the Pressure or Pressure Level button to select High Pressure. Use the \u2013 or + button to set the time to 30 minutes.",
            "When the cooking cycle ends, press Cancel. Allow the appliance to cool and release pressure naturally, about 20 minutes. (The pressure is released when the small metal float valve next to the pressure-release valve sinks back into the lid and the lid is no longer locked.)",
            "Remove the lid. Discard the bay leaves. Use tongs or a large spoon to remove the beef from the inner pot and place it on a cutting board. Shred the beef using two forks: Use one fork to pull off a chunk and then use two forks to shred that piece, holding down the meat with one fork and pulling at it with the other. Repeat with the remaining beef.",
            "Serve the beef hot, piled into corn tortillas and topped with salsa and a sprinkling of Cotija cheese, if desired."
