        "title": "Chocolate Hazelnut Tart ",
        "ingredients": [
            "1 1/2 cups graham cracker crumbs",
            "3/4 stick (6 tablespoons) unsalted butter, melted",
            "1/4 teaspoon salt",
            "1 cup hazelnuts (4 3/4 oz), coarsely chopped",
            "1 cup heavy cream",
            "10 1/2 oz fine-quality bittersweet chocolate (not unsweetened), finely chopped",
            "1/2 cup chocolate-hazelnut spread such as Nutella",
            "a 9-inch (24-cm) springform pan"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Put oven racks in upper and lower thirds of oven and preheat oven to 350\u00b0F. Invert bottom of springform pan (so that turned-up edge is underneath for easier removal of tart) and close side of pan onto bottom.",
            "Stir together crumbs, butter, and 1/8 teaspoon salt in a bowl, then press onto bottom of springform pan. Bake crust in lower third of oven 7 minutes, then cool crust in springform pan on a rack.",
            "While crust bakes, toast hazelnuts in a shallow baking pan in upper third of oven, stirring once, until golden, about 7 minutes. Transfer to a plate and cool to room temperature.",
            "Make filling while crust cools: Bring cream to a boil in a 1- to 2-quart saucepan, then pour over chocolate in a heatproof bowl, whisking until chocolate is melted and smooth. Whisk in chocolate-hazelnut spread until combined, then whisk in nuts and remaining 1/8 teaspoon salt. Pour filling onto cooled crust and put in freezer until just set, about 25 minutes. (Tart should not be frozen.) Remove side of pan before serving tart.",
