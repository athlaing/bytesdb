            "1/4 cup sugar",
            "1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh orange zest",
            "2 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened",
            "1 large egg white",
            "1/4 teaspoon vanilla",
            "2 tablespoons all-purpose flour",
            "a nonstick bakeware liner such as a Silpat; a small offset spatula; 4 wooden spoons with round handles or 4 pencils"

        "instructions": [
            "Put oven rack in middle position and preheat oven to 400\u00b0F. Put nonstick liner on a baking sheet. Grind together sugar and zest in a food processor 1 minute. Add butter and blend until combined well, then add egg white, vanilla, and a pinch of salt and blend until incorporated. Add flour and pulse until just combined. Spoon 1/2 teaspoon batter in a 5-inch line at one end of nonstick liner, then spread into a strip (about 3/4 inch wide and 5 inches long) with offset spatula. Make 3 more strips on same liner and bake until golden all over, 5 to 7 minutes. Cool strips on baking sheet 30 seconds (to facilitate removal), then carefully remove 1 strip with cleaned spatula and invert onto a work surface. Working quickly, wrap strip twice in a spiral around handle of a wooden spoon and transfer (still wrapped around handle) to a rack to cool and harden, about 1 minute. Repeat with remaining strips. (If strips become too brittle to work with, return to oven a few seconds to soften.) When cool and hard, remove wooden spoons and transfer tuiles to a tray. Make more tuiles in same manner, cooling and cleaning nonstick liner and spatula between batches.",
