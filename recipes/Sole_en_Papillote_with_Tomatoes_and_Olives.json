        "instructions": [
            "Heat oven to 450\u00b0F. Fold four 15-inch-square pieces of parchment in half. Starting at fold of each piece, draw half a large heart shape. Cut along lines; open. Place 1 fish fillet next to crease on each piece of parchment. In a small skillet, warm 1 tbsp oil over medium heat. Saut\u00e9 sliced garlic and pepper flakes until garlic turns golden, 1 minute. Remove skillet from heat; stir in tomatoes, capers and olives. Sprinkle fish with salt and pepper. Divide tomato mixture among fish. Top each fillet with 2 teaspoon wine, 1 teaspoon butter and 2 thyme sprigs. Fold other half of parchment over fish. Starting at top of each parchment half-heart, make small, tight, overlapping folds along outside edge to seal packet; twist tail ends tightly to seal completely. Place packets on a large rimmed baking sheet; roast 8 minutes. Broil or toast ciabatta until golden; rub with garlic clove halves and brush with remaining 4 teaspoon oil. Transfer packets to plates. Slit tops with a knife; gently open. Serve 1 slice ciabatta with each packet."
