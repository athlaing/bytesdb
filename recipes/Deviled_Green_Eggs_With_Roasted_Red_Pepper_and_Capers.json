Set aside for 15 minutes to allow the eggs to cook through. Place under cold running water to cool. Drain and peel. Cut the eggs in half lengthwise, scoop out the yolks, and transfer them to a small bowl. Set aside.",

Transfer the egg whites to a plate and fill them with the yolk mixture. Top with the roasted red peppers, capers, and jalape\u00f1o, if using.
