            "Preheat oven to 325\u00b0F. Blend basil and oil in a food processor until smooth. Place lamb in a roasting pan. Season generously with salt and pepper and rub basil pur\u00e9e all over. Cover with foil, and cook until fork-tender, 3-3 1/2 hours. Increase oven temperature to 500\u00b0F. Remove foil and roast lamb until golden brown, 10-15 minutes. Let rest 30 minutes. Pour pan juices into a measuring cup and skim; set jus aside.",
            "For polenta: Reduce oven temperature to 325\u00b0F. Mix thyme, shallot, garlic, polenta, cream, and 3 cups broth in a 13x9x2\" baking dish; season with salt and pepper. Cover with foil and bake, without stirring, until polenta is softened and liquid is almost completely absorbed, 60-75 minutes. Thin polenta with more broth, if needed.",

            "For beans and assembly: Bring sugar, vinegar, chili paste, 1 teaspoon salt, and 1/3 cup water to a boil in a small saucepan.
