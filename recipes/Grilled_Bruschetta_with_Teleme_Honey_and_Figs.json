        "ingredients": [
            "8 5 x 3 x 1/2-inch slices crusty country-style bread",
            "Olive oil",
            "1 8-ounce piece ripe Teleme cheese or Havarti cheese, cut into 8 slices",
            "8 ripe fresh figs, stemmed, quartered lengthwise",
            "Dark full-flavored honey (such as forest honey)"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Prepare barbecue (medium-high heat). Brush both sides of bread with oil. Place bread slices directly on 1 side of grill rack; place sheet of foil large enough to hold bread slices on other side of grill rack. Grill bread until grill marks appear on bottom, about 3 minutes. Turn bread slices over and place bread, grilled side down, on foil. Place 1 cheese slice atop each bread slice; close barbecue and grill bread until cheese melts, about 3 minutes. Transfer bread to work surface; cut each slice into 4 pieces. Top each piece with fig slice. Drizzle lightly with honey and sprinkle lightly with freshly ground black pepper. Transfer to platter and serve."
