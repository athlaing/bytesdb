        "ingredients": [
            "1 teaspoon active dry yeast (from a 1 1/4-oz envelope)",
            "2 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon sugar",
            "1/4 cup warm water (105\u00b0-115\u00b0F)",
            "1 cup all-purpose flour",
            "1/2 teaspoon salt",
            "1 cup warm whole milk (105\u00b0-115\u00b0F)",
            "3 large eggs",
            "1/2 stick (1/4 cup) unsalted butter, melted and cooled",
            "1 cup fine-quality apricot preserves",
            "1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice",
            "Confectioners sugar for dusting"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Stir together yeast, 1 teaspoon sugar, and warm water in a small bowl and let stand until foamy, about 5 minutes. (If mixture doesn't foam, discard and start over with new yeast, sugar, and warm water.)",
            "Transfer yeast mixture to a blender and add flour, salt, milk, and remaining 2 tablespoons sugar, then blend until combined. Pour into a bowl and cover with a kitchen towel. Let stand in a warm, draft-free place until almost doubled in bulk, about 1 hour. Return mixture to blender and add eggs and 2 tablespoons butter. Blend until smooth.",
            "Make blini: Lightly brush a 10-inch nonstick skillet with melted butter, then heat over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking. Holding skillet off heat, pour in 1/3 cup batter, immediately tilting and rotating skillet to coat bottom. (If batter sets before skillet is coated, reduce heat slightly.) Return skillet to heat and cook cr\u00eape until underside and edges are just set and golden, about 1 1/2 minutes. (Loosen edge of cr\u00eape with a heatproof rubber spatula to check.) Flip cr\u00eape over carefully with your fingertips. Cook until other side is golden, about 1 minute more. Transfer cr\u00eape to a plate. Brush skillet with more melted butter and make 7 more cr\u00eapes in same manner, stacking them as made and brushing skillet between each cr\u00eape. Pur\u00e9e preserves and lemon juice in a food processor until smooth. Spread 1/2 tablespoon preserves on a cr\u00eape and fold in eighths to form a triangle. Repeat with remaining preserves and cr\u00eapes. Brush a 12-inch heavy skillet with remaining butter and arrange cr\u00eapes in 1 layer with points at center of skillet. Cook over moderate heat until cr\u00eapes are beginning to brown, 1 to 2 minutes, then flip cr\u00eapes over with a spatula and cook 1 minute more. Transfer to a platter and dust with confectioners sugar.",
