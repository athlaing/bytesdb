            "Combine 2 cups water and sugar in a small saucepan and sprinkle with gelatin. Let gelatin stand 1 minute to soften. Cook over moderate heat, gently stirring occasionally, just until sugar and gelatin are dissolved. Remove from heat and stir in wine, schnapps, and remaining cup water. Pour into a 10-cup mold and chill, covered, until firm, at least 10 hours. Dip mold in hot water a few seconds, then invert a plate over gel\u00e9e and flip gel\u00e9e onto plate.",
