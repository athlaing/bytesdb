            "2 teaspoons garlic powder",
            "1 teaspoon dried basil",
            "1 teaspoon dried oregano",
            "1 teaspoon mustard powder",

            "1 egg",
            "2 pounds ground beef",
            "1 pound loose Italian sausage meat (mild or hot, to taste)",
            "1/3 cup hoisin sauce",
            "1/3 cup ketchup",
            "1/2 teaspoon hot sauce"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Heat the oven to 375\u00b0F. Line a rimmed baking sheet with foil, then coat with cooking spray.",
            "In a large bowl, combine the panko, garlic powder, basil, oregano, mustard powder, paprika, and salt. Set aside.",
            "In a food processor, combine the carrots, onion, and egg. Process until very finely chopped. Add to the breadcrumb mixture and mix well. Add the ground beef and sausage meat, then gently but thoroughly mix. The mixture will be solid and on the dry side.",
            "Divide the mixture in half and transfer one portion to one side of the prepared baking sheet. Form into a loaf about 8 inches long and 2 inches high.",
            "Repeat with the remaining half, forming it into a loaf next to the first, leaving several inches between them.",
            "In a small bowl, mix together the hoisin, ketchup, and hot sauce. Spoon over the top and sides of the meatloaves.",
            "Bake for 40 to 45 minutes, until the meatloaves reach 155\u00b0F at the center."
