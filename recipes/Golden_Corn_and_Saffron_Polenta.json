            "Heat chicken fat in large saucepan over medium-low heat. Add onion; cover and cook 5 minutes (do not brown). Add broth, 1 1/4 teaspoons coarse salt, and saffron; bring to boil.

Cover; simmer until polenta is cooked through and very thick, stirring with flat- bottom spoon, about 10 minutes longer. Meanwhile, blend corn kernels in processor until coarse puree forms; mix into polenta. Season with pepper. DO AHEAD: can be made 2 hours ahead. Let stand at room temperature.
