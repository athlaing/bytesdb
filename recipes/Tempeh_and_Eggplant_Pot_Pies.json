            "2 tablespoons (30 ml) water or olive oil",
            "1 small-size yellow onion, chopped",
            "1 celery stalk, chopped",
            "1 teaspoon (2 g) fennel seeds",
            "1 to 2 tablespoons (8 to 16 g) capers, rinsed",

            "1 can or jar ( 15 ounces, or 420 g) tomato sauce",

            "1 2/3 cups (210 g) all-purpose flour",
            "1 tablespoon (15 g) baking powder (look for aluminum-free)",
            "1/2 teaspoon salt",
            "2/3 cup (160 ml) nondairy milk (soy, rice, almond, hazelnut, hemp, or oat)",
            "1/3 cup (80 ml) canola oil or nondairy, nonhydrogenated butter (such as Earth Balance), melted"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Preheat oven to 425\u00b0F (220\u00b0C, or gas mark 7). Coat 4 or 6 individual ramekins with oil, and set aside. You also can use a 9-inch (23 cm) square pan or a rectangular pan.",
            "To make filling, steam eggplant and tempeh for 10 to 15 minutes, until eggplant is soft and translucent. At the same time, add water or oil to a large-size saut\u00e9 pan and cook onion and celery until soft. Add fennel seeds, capers, and vinegar, and saut\u00e9 for 1 minute. Add tomato sauce, red pepper flakes, and cooked tempeh and eggplant. Simmer for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.",
            "Meanwhile, prepare biscuit dough. Place flour, baking powder, and salt in a mixing bowl, and stir together. Pour in nondairy milk and butter or oil, and mix just until dry ingredients are evenly moistened. The dough should be lumpy and sticky, not smooth like cake batter.",
            "Remove saut\u00e9 pan from heat, and season filling with salt and pepper, to taste.",
            "Divide filling evenly among prepared ramekins. Drop dough by small spoonfuls on top of each ramekin. Carefully spread dough with back of spoon so it evenly covers filling. Bake pot pies until crust is golden, about 15 minutes. Serve hot."
