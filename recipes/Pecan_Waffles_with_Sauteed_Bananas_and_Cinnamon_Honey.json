            "To Make The Waffles Preheat a waffle iron according to the manufacturer's directions. Preheat the oven to 200\u00b0F. In a food processor, pulverize the pecans until finely ground. Add the eggs, butter, honey, vanilla, baking soda, and salt, and blend well. Grease the waffle iron using a partially wrapped stick of cold butter. Hold the butter by its wrapped end and rub the other end all over the waffle iron's cooking surface. Add 1/4 cup batter and cook for a few minutes, until golden brown. Set right on the oven rack to crisp up and keep warm while you cook more.",
