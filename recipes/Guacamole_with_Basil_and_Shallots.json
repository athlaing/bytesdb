            "What to drink: With the appetizers, put out a couple of options. Prosecco (Italy's answer to Champagne) is always a good choice. For this party, Kate and Scott poured Botter NV Verduzzo Prosecco Frizzante ($17), a light-bodied sparkler from the Veneto region. They also offered Peroni Nastro Azzurro ($9 for a six-pack), a dry Italian lager with hoppy aromas.",
