        "ingredients": [
            "200g (1 2/3 cups) plain flour",
            "20g (about 1/4 cup) ground almonds",
            "35g (1/3 cup) confectioners' sugar",
            "125g (1/2 cup/1 stick) cold butter, diced",
            "1 egg, separated"

        "instructions": [
            "Put the flour, almonds, and confectioners' sugar into a large bowl and mix together until well combined. Add the butter to the dry ingredients and rub into the flour until you get a mixture that looks like fine breadcrumbs. Add the egg yolk (save the white for glazing) and 1 tablespoon of cold water and stir into the flour with a round-ended knife. The mixture will start to clump together after you have mixed for a minute or so, but there will still be some floury patches in the bowl. Turn the contents of the bowl onto a large piece of cling film and knead briefly until all the pastry has come together into a ball. Wrap in the cling film and place in the fridge for 30 minutes, or until you are ready to use it.",

            "Blind baking: Preheat the oven to 375\u00b0F/190\u00b0C/170\u00b0C fan/gas 5. Roll out the chilled pastry between two pieces of cling film until it is a few centimeters larger than your tin. You could also do this on a floured surface, but the pastry is so fragile I find it easier to handle between cling film. Peel off the top layer of cling film then invert the pastry circle into the prepared tart tin, gently pressing it into all the edges. Put the pastry-lined tin into the fridge for at least 30 minutes before baking. Remove the cling film from the pastry, prick the base all over with a fork then line the inside with baking parchment and baking beans (you could also use uncooked lentils or rice if you don\u2019t have baking beans\u2014anything that will weigh the paper down). Bake for ten minutes, then carefully remove the paper and beans and bake for a further ten minutes, until the base is crisp. You are now ready to fill the case.",
