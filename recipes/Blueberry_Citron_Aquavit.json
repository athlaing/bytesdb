            "Wash and dry blueberries. Pour off about 2 tablespoons vodka (just enough for a teeny Martini) to make room for blueberries. Put berries in bottle of vodka. Let vodka stand at room temperature 3 days. Freeze aquavit in bottle at least 8 hours, or until ice-cold, and up to 3 days. (Because of its high alcohol content, aquavit will remain liquid.) Pour aquavit into a decanter and serve ice-cold.",
