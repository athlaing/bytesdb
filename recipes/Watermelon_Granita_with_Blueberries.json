        "ingredients": [
            "6 cups (about 2 pounds) seedless watermelon, cubed",
            "1/2 cup fresh lime juice",
            "1/3 cup agave nectar",
            "2 cups fresh blueberries",
            "6 mint sprigs (optional)"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "In a food processor, puree watermelon, working in 2 batches. Strain puree through a sieve, reserving liquid; discard solids. In a 9\" x 13\" metal pan, combine watermelon puree, juice and agave. Freeze, scraping thoroughly with a fork every 20 to 30 minutes, until granita resembles coarse crystals, 2 to 4 hours. Remove from freezer; scrape granita once more with a fork. Divide among 6 glasses. Top each with 1/3 cup blueberries and a mint sprig, if desired."
