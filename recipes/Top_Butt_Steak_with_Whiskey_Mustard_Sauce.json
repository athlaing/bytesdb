        "ingredients": [
            "1 (2- to 2 1/4-pounds) boneless top butt sirloin steak (about 1 inch thick)",
            "1 tablespoon olive oil",
            "2 tablespoons finely chopped shallot",
            "1/2 cup whiskey",
            "1 cup reduced-sodium chicken broth",
            "2 tablespoons whole-grain mustard",
            "3 tablespoons unsalted butter",
            "1/2 teaspoon cider vinegar"

            "Pat steak dry and sprinkle with 1 teaspoon salt and 3/4 teaspoon pepper.",
            "Heat oil in a 12-inch heavy skillet over medium-high heat until it shimmers, then sear steak, turning once, about 8 minutes total for medium-rare. Let steak rest on a platter, uncovered, 10 minutes.",
            "While steak rests, add shallot to skillet and cook, stirring, until softened, about 2 minutes. Add whiskey and carefully ignite with a long kitchen match (use caution; flames will shoot up). When flames die down, whisk in broth and mustard and boil until sauce is reduced to about 1/2 cup, about 6 minutes. Add meat juices from platter, then whisk in butter and vinegar.",
