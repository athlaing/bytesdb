Add onion, carrot, and celery and cook, stirring and turning wings often, until everything in pan is deeply browned, 14\u201316 minutes. Add herbs and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 1 minute.

Simmer, whisking often, until gravy is thickened and reduced to about 3 cups (it should coat a spoon), 8\u201310 minutes. Stir in Worcestershire sauce, taste, and season with salt and pepper",
