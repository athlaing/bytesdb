            "1/4 cup firmly packed brown sugar",

            "3 tablespoons black pepper",
            "3 tablespoons coarse salt",
            "1 tablespoon hickory-smoked salt or more coarse salt",
            "2 teaspoons garlic powder",
            "2 teaspoons onion powder",

        "instructions": [
            "Combine all the ingredients in a mixing bowl and stir to mix. (Actually, your hands work better for mixing than a spoon or whisk does. Use your fingers to break up any lump of brown sugar.) Store the rub in an airtight jar away from heat or light; it will keep for at least 6 months."
