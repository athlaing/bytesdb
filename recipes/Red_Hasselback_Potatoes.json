        "ingredients": [
            "Cooking spray",
            "2 1/2 pounds medium red-skin potatoes (about 8), scrubbed",
            "6 garlic cloves, chopped",
            "1/4 cup olive oil",
            "2 teaspoons kosher salt",

        ],
        "instructions": [
            "1. Preheat the oven to 375\u00b0F. Spray a baking sheet with cooking spray.",
            "2. Place each potato in a large wooden spoon. Thinly slice the potato vertically, about every 1/8 inch, being careful not to slice all the way through to the bottom. The shape of the spoon should help prevent it.",
            "3. Place the potatoes on the prepared baking sheet. Sprinkle the garlic evenly over all the potatoes, and use your fingers to push it into the slits. Drizzle with the olive oil and sprinkle with the salt and pepper. Bake until tender and browned, 60 to 70 minutes.",
            "Variation: For the garlic lovers in the crowd, thinly slice the garlic and place it in the potato slits. You can sub in or add chopped shallots to the garlic in this recipe.",
