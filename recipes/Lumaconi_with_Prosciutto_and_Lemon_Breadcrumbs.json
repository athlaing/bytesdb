            "Add thyme, bay leaf, lemon zest, and cream to skillet and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer until cream is slightly reduced, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and let steep 30 minutes. Strain through a fine-mesh sieve into a medium bowl; discard solids.",
            "Do ahead: Prosciutto cream can be made 1 day ahead. Cover and chill.",
            "Breadcrumbs: Heat oil in a medium skillet over medium-high heat. Add garlic and cook just until golden, about 2 minutes. Add breadcrumbs and cook, stirring constantly, until golden brown, about 4 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer to paper towels to drain; let cool. Discard garlic and transfer breadcrumbs to a medium bowl. Add lemon zest and toss to combine; season with salt. Do ahead: Breadcrumbs (without lemon zest) can be cooked 1 day ahead.
