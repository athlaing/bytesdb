            "Using a 1-ounce ice cream scoop or tablespoon measure, drop a scant scoop's worth of batter or 2 scant tablespoons of batter onto a lined baking sheet to form 1 mound. Make 15 more mounds, arranging them 2 inches apart until baking sheet is full (you will have batter left over).",
            "Bake until springy to the touch, 12 to 18 minutes. Transfer cookie-cakes to rack to cool.",

Heat over moderate heat until sugar dissolves, then bring to a boil. Stir in pecans. Spread mixture on lined sheet pan and bake until coating is bubbling and golden brown, about 10 minutes.
