            "Rice and Assembly: Heat oil in a large wok or skillet over medium-high heat. Add tortillas and cook, stirring occasionally, until golden brown and crisp, about 2 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer chips to paper towels to drain. (Alternatively, use storebought corn chips.) Increase heat to high and add onion and jalape\u00f1o to same wok; season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring often, until softened and fragrant, about 2 minutes. Add eggs and cook, stirring constantly, until fluffy and just set, about 1 minute. Add rice and cook, stirring often, until rice is evenly coated and beginning to brown, about 4 minutes. Add jaew and cook, stirring occasionally, until fragrant and paste reduces slightly, about 2 minutes. Remove from heat and mix in cheddar and half of fried tortillas.
