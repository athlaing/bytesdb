            "Lay chiles on their sides on racks of gas burners, then turn flames on moderately high and roast chiles, turning with tongs, until skins are blistered, 5 to 7 minutes. (Or broil on rack of a broiler pan about 2 inches from heat, turning, 8 to 10 minutes.) Transfer chiles immediately to a large bowl and cover tightly. Let steam 10 minutes, then peel or rub off skins and discard stems, seeds, and ribs. Cut chiles into 1/3-inch pieces.",
            "Heat oil in a 12-inch heavy skillet over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking, then saut\u00e9 onion and red bell pepper, stirring occasionally, until golden, about 6 minutes. Add garlic, black pepper, cumin seeds, and 1/4 teaspoon salt and saut\u00e9, stirring, until garlic is fragrant, about 1 minute.",
            "Add corn, tomatoes, squash, and 1/2 teaspoon salt and cook over moderately high heat, covered, stirring occasionally, until vegetables are just tender and have exuded liquid, 8 to 10 minutes. Remove lid and continue to cook, stirring occasionally, until most of liquid is evaporated, about 5 minutes.",
            "Stir in chiles, cream, lime juice, 2 tablespoons cilantro, and remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt and continue to cook, stirring occasionally, until liquid is slightly thickened, about 3 minutes. Sprinkle with remaining tablespoon cilantro."
