        "ingredients": [
            "1 4-pound center-cut beef tenderloin, fat and silverskin trimmed",
            "Kosher salt",
            "4 teaspoons freshly ground black pepper plus more for seasoning",
            "2/3 cup fine fresh breadcrumbs made from day-old white bread",
            "2/3 cup finely grated Parmesan",
            "2/3 cup mayonnaise",
            "4 anchovy fillets packed in oil, drained, finely chopped",
            "4 teaspoons Dijon mustard",
            "4 teaspoons finely grated lemon zest",
            "2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce",
            "2 garlic cloves, finely chopped"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Season tenderloin lightly with salt and pepper. Wrap in plastic; refrigerate overnight. Uncover tenderloin; let stand at room temperature for at least 2 hours. Preheat oven to 400\u00b0F. Set a rack inside a rimmed baking sheet. Transfer tenderloin to rack. Pulse 4 teaspoons black pepper and remaining ingredients in a small food processor until well blended. Generously and evenly spread and pack Parmesan mixture around tenderloin. Roast until crust is golden brown and an instant-read thermometer inserted into thickest part of tenderloin registers 110\u00b0F-115\u00b0F for rare and 120\u00b0F-125\u00b0F for medium-rare, 30-40 minutes. Transfer to a carving board. Let rest for 20 minutes. Cut into 1/2\"-thick slices, taking care not to lose too much of the delicate crust.",
