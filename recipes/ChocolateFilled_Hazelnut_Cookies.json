            "1 cup confectioners sugar",
            "1 stick (1/2 cup) unsalted butter, well softened",

        "instructions": [
            "Put oven rack in middle position and preheat oven to 350\u00b0F. Line 2 or 3 baking sheets with parchment paper.",
            "Grind nuts with confectioners sugar in a food processor until powdery (be careful not to process to a paste).",
            "Beat together butter, zest, salt, and nut mixture in a large bowl with a rubber spatula or wooden spoon until creamy, then add flour, stirring until just incorporated (do not overwork).",
            "Roll level 1/2 teaspoons of dough into tiny balls (the size of marbles) and arrange 1 inch apart on baking sheets. Bake, 1 sheet at a time, until very pale golden, 12 to 14 minutes, then slide parchment with cookies onto a rack to cool completely.",
            "Melt chocolate in a metal bowl set over a saucepan of barely simmering water, stirring occasionally, until smooth. Spoon melted chocolate into a small plastic bag and seal bag, forcing out excess air. Snip off 1 bottom corner of bag with scissors to form a small hole.",
            "Pipe a small mound (about 1/8 teaspoon) of melted chocolate onto flat sides of 10 cookies, then top with 10 more cookies, pressing flat sides together to help adhere. Repeat procedure with remaining cookies."
