            "1 cup fresh lemon juice",
            "1/4 cup dried mint",
            "1 medium head of cabbage (about 1 1/2 lb.), halved, very thinly sliced",
            "2 tsp. kosher salt, plus more",
            "1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil, plus more"

        "instructions": [
            "Combine lemon juice and mint in a large bowl. Add cabbage and 2 tsp. salt. Toss cabbage with your hands for a few minutes, squeezing to help soften (the lemon juice and salt will continue to tenderize it as it sits). Add 1/4 cup oil and toss again to coat. Cover and chill at least 2 hours and up to 12 hours. To serve, taste and season with more salt and drizzle with oil.",
