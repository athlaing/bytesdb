        "ingredients": [
            "1 pound fresh or 3/4 pound frozen rhubarb (do not thaw)",
            "1/2 cup granulated sugar",
            "3/4 cup chilled heavy cream",
            "3 tablespoons confectioners sugar",
            "1/3 cup sour cream",
            "1 tablespoon Sherry",
            "8 gingersnaps, finely ground (6 tablespoons)"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "If using fresh rhubarb, trim and finely chop.",
            "Cook rhubarb and granulated sugar in a wide 3- to 4-quart heavy saucepan over moderately high heat, stirring constantly, until rhubarb begins to give off juices. Reduce heat and simmer, stirring frequently, until rhubarb falls apart and is reduced to about 1 1/2 cups, about 20 minutes.",
            "Transfer rhubarb to a metal bowl set in a larger bowl of ice and cold water and chill, stirring occasionally, until cold, about 5 minutes.",
            "Beat heavy cream and confectioners sugar in a bowl with an electric mixer until it just holds stiff peaks. Add sour cream and Sherry and beat until it returns to stiff-peak stage.",
            "Decoratively layer 1/3 cup rhubarb, 1/2 cup whipped cream, and 1 1/2 tablespoons gingersnap crumbs in each of 4 (6-ounce) stemmed glasses (there will be a little rhubarb left over). Chill until ready to serve."
