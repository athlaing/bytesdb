            "1 tablespoon vegetable oil",
            "1 1/2 tablespoons unsalted butter",
            "1 garlic clove, smashed",
            "1 thyme sprig",
            "1 tablespoon finely chopped shallot",
            "2 tablespoon Cognac",
            "2/3 cup cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche",

        "instructions": [
            "Preheat oven to 350\u00b0F with rack in middle. Pour boiling water over morels in a small bowl and soak until morels are softened, about 30 minutes. Transfer morels with a slotted spoon to a medium-mesh sieve set over a bowl. Press on morels with back of spoon to remove excess liquid (be careful not to squeeze out all the moisture), then add to soaking liquid and reserve. Rinse morels to remove any grit. Reserve morels and liquid separately, allowing liquid to settle. While morels soak, let veal chops stand at room temperature 30 minutes. Pat chops dry and season with 1/2 teaspoon each of salt and pepper (total). Heat an ovenproof 12-inch heavy skillet (not nonstick) over medium-high heat until hot. Add oil and heat until smoking, then add veal chops and sear underside well, 2 to 3 minutes. Turn chops over and sear 1 minute. Add butter, garlic, and thyme to skillet and baste veal with melting butter. Transfer skillet to oven and cook, basting every few minutes, until an instant-read thermometer inserted horizontally into center of chop registers 130 to 135\u00b0F for medium-rare, 10 to 15 minutes. Transfer chops to a plate to rest. Discard garlic and thyme, keeping juices and fat in skillet, and return to burner over medium-high heat. (Handle will be very hot.) Add morels and saut\u00e9 1 minute. Add shallot and saut\u00e9 1 minute. Remove from heat briefly and add Cognac, then return to heat and deglaze, stirring and scraping up brown bits, until most of liquid has evaporated. Slowly pour in reserved soaking liquid, being careful to leave last tablespoon (containing sediment) in bowl. Add meat juices from plate and boil until liquid has reduced to about 1/3 cup. Stir in cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche, swirling to incorporate, and boil until morels are lightly coated and liquid is slightly thickened. Stir in chives and tarragon and season with salt and pepper. Serve chops smothered with morels.",
