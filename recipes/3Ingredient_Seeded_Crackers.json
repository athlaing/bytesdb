        "ingredients": [
            "2 cups whole wheat flour",
            "1 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more",
            "1/3 cup olive oil",
            "1 tablespoon honey",
            "1 tablespoon fennel, sesame, and/or caraway seeds"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Preheat oven to 375\u00b0F. Pulse flour and 1 tsp. salt in a food processor to combine. Stir oil, honey, and 2/3 cup water in a liquid measuring cup. With motor running, add oil mixture to dry ingredients and continue to pulse until a ball of dough forms around blade. Turn dough out onto a work surface. Divide in half. Cover one half with a moistened towel, then roll remaining half into a rough 15x10\" rectangle. Repeat with second half. Transfer each to a large parchment-lined baking sheet. Using a pizza cutter or sharp paring knife, trim ragged edges. Cut each rectangle into 24 (6x4\") pieces. Fill a spray bottle with water and mist top of dough (or use a pastry brush to brush water on dough). Sprinkle with seeds and more salt. With your hands, press down lightly on dough to adhere seeds. Bake crackers, rotating sheets halfway through and checking for doneness frequently toward end of baking time (they can quickly brown), until slightly brown and crunchy, 15\u201318 minutes. Let cool (they'll crisp up) before serving.",
