            "Preheat oven to 350\u00b0F. Toast walnuts on a rimmed baking sheet, tossing once, until golden brown, 7\u201310 minutes. Let cool, then chop.",
            "Heat 3 Tbsp. oil in a large skillet over medium-high. Season pork loin (look for one with a nice dark color and some fat on it) with salt and cook until browned on all sides, 10\u201315 minutes. Transfer pork to a platter.",
            "Add onions and beets to same skillet and cook, stirring often, until onions are slightly translucent and browned, 10\u201312 minutes; season with salt and pepper. Add garlic, sauerkraut, brine, broth, wine, and 2 Tbsp. lemon juice and bring to a simmer. Cover skillet, reduce heat to low, and cook until beets are fork-tender, 25\u201330 minutes.",
            "Return pork to skillet and push down into liquid. Turn heat up to medium and simmer, uncovered, turning meat occasionally until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of loin registers 150\u00b0F, 20\u201330 minutes. Transfer pork to a cutting board and let rest 5 minutes before slicing.",
            "Meanwhile, mix walnuts, mint, parsley, apricots, remaining 2 Tbsp. lemon juice, and remaining 1/2 cup oil in a small bowl; season with salt and pepper.",
            "Spoon beet mixture onto plates and arrange sliced pork on top. Spoon a generous amount of walnut sauce over."
