            "Preheat oven to 425\u00baF. Line 2 rimmed baking sheets with parchment paper. Arrange mushrooms and 2 thyme sprigs in a single layer on prepared baking sheets. Drizzle with oil; season with 3/4 tsp. salt and 1/2 tsp. pepper. Roast mushrooms, stirring once and rotating pan halfway through, until lightly golden, crisp-tender, and liquid is evaporated (watch carefully as cook time can vary between types of mushrooms), 25\u201335 minutes. Remove sheets from oven and reduce oven temperature to 375\u00baF.",
            "Meanwhile, cook green beans in a large pot of boiling generously salted water until crisp-tender, 3\u20135 minutes. Drain in a colander and rinse under cold water to stop cooking. Drain well, then layer on a rimmed baking sheet with paper towels and pat dry. Wipe pot dry.",
            "Melt butter over medium-low heat in same pot. Add onion and garlic and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender, 5\u20138 minutes. Stir in flour and cook, stirring occasionally, until aroma is mildly nutty, 4\u20136 minutes. Add 3 Tbsp. cream and stir well to combine. Repeat twice, then stir in remaining cream, broth, bay leaves, and remaining 2 thyme sprigs. Bring to a simmer and cook, stirring occasionally and scraping sides of pot, until sauce is the consistency of slightly thickened cream and coats the back of a wooden spoon, about 20 minutes (do not over-reduce). Discard thyme and bay leaves. Stir in zest, 1/2 tsp. salt, and 1/4 tsp. pepper.",
            "Arrange beans and mushrooms in 3-qt. baking dish. Pour cream sauce over; stir to evenly coat. Bake casserole until sauce is thickened and bubbling around the edges, about 20 minutes.",
            "Make the fried onion topping: Pour oil into a large wide pot or high-sided skillet to a depth of 1/2\". Heat over medium-high until hot but not smoking (about 350\u00b0F on a deep-fry thermometer). Line a rimmed baking sheet with paper towels. Whisk cornmeal, cornstarch, paprika, coriander, and cumin in a large shallow bowl. Toss onion rings in cornstarch mixture to coat. Working in batches, fry onion rings, stirring and turning occasionally, until golden and crisp, 2\u20133 minutes. Using tongs or a slotted spoon, transfer to prepared sheet to drain. Season with salt and pepper while hot.",
