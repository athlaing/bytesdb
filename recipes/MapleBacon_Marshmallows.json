        "ingredients": [
            "4 1/2 teaspoons unflavored powdered gelatin",
            "1/2 cup cold water",
            "2/3 cup sugar",
            "1/2 cup Grade A dark or Grade B maple syrup*",
            "1/4 cup light corn syrup",
            "1/4 cup water",
            "1/4 teaspoon salt",
            "1/8 teaspoon ground cinnamon",
            "1/2 cup (about 1 1/2 ounces) finely chopped candied bacon**",
            "1/2 cup Classic Coating, plus more for dusting",
            "*The key to getting real maple flavor is using a dark amber Grade A or Grade B syrup, which are bolder than lighter Grade A varieties.",
            "**To make candied bacon, lay 6 or 7 bacon slices on a wire rack set over a sheet pan lined with foil. Combine 1/4 cup light brown sugar with 1/8 teaspoon ground cinnamon. Rub over both sides of bacon. Bake at 350\u00b0F until deeply caramelized, 30 to 35 minutes. Let cool before chopping into bits."

        "instructions": [
            "Lightly coat an 8-by-8-inch baking pan with cooking spray.",
            "WHISK TOGETHER the gelatin and cold water in a small bowl. Let it soften for 5 minutes.",
            "STIR TOGETHER the sugar, maple syrup, corn syrup, water, and salt in a medium saucepan. Bring it to a boil over high heat, stirring occasionally, until it hits 240\u00b0F. Be prepared to lower the heat as needed-this syrup likes to bubble up. Microwave the gelatin on high until completely melted, about 30 seconds. Pour it into the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment. Set the mixer to low and keep it running.",
            "WHEN THE SYRUP reaches 240\u00b0F, slowly pour it into the mixer bowl. Increase the speed to medium and beat for 5 minutes. Increase to medium-high and beat for 3 more minutes. Add the cinnamon, increase to the highest speed, and beat for 1 minute more. Quickly fold in the bacon bits. Pour the marshmallow into the prepared pan. Sift coating over top. Let it set for 6 hours in a cool, dry place. Use a knife to loosen the marshmallow from the edges of the pan. Invert the slab onto a work surface. Cut it into pieces and dust them with more coating."
