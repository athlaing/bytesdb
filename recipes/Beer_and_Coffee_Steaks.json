Brush and oil rack, then grill steaks until darkly crusted and done the way you like, about 3 minutes per side for medium-rare (about 145\u00b0F on an instant-read thermometer), or 4 to 5 minutes per side for medium (about 160\u00b0F on an instant-read thermometer). Let meat rest off heat 5 minutes to redistribute juices.",
