            "Preheat broiler.",
            "In 10-inch heavy skillet over moderate heat, melt butter. Add panko and cook, stirring occasionally, until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Add cinnamon, pepper, and sugar, and toss to combine. Transfer to medium bowl and set aside.",
            "Spoon 2 tablespoons cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche onto center of each ovenproof plate. Arrange 1/2 cup strawberries on top of each circle of cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche. Drizzle each plate with 1 1/2 teaspoons honey and sprinkle with 1 tablespoon panko mixture. Working in batches, place plates on large rimmed baking sheet and broil until the cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche starts to bubble and turn light golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes. Keep warm while broiling other batches and serve immediately."
