Cool crust completely. Reduce oven temperature to 325\u00b0F.",
            "For Filling: Stir chocolate in top of double boiler set over simmering water until smooth. Remove from over water. Using electric mixer, beat cream cheese in large bowl until smooth. Gradually add sugar, beating until blended. Beat in flour. Add eggs 1 at a time, beating to blend after each addition. Beat in cream and both extracts. Stir in 2 cups coconut. Transfer filling to crust. Drizzle melted chocolate over filling. Using small knife, swirl chocolate and coconut batter together on surface, forming decorative pattern.
