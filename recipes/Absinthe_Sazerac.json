            "1 1/2 cups ice cubes",
            "1 cube or 1/2 teaspoon sugar",
            "4 dashes Peychaud Bitters*",
            "1/4 cup (2 ounces) rye whiskey",

        "instructions": [
            "Fill old-fashioned glass with 1 cup ice and set aside. In second old-fashioned glass, stir together sugar, bitters, and \u00bd teaspoon water until sugar is completely dissolved, about 30 seconds. Add rye whiskey and remaining \u00bd cup ice, and stir well, at least 15 seconds. From first glass, discard ice, then add absinthe. Holding glass horizontally, roll it between your thumbs and forefingers so that absinthe completely coats the interior, then discard excess. Strain rye whiskey mixture into chilled, absinthe-coated glass. Squeeze lemon peel over drink, making sure oils fall into glass, then drop peel into drink, and serve."
