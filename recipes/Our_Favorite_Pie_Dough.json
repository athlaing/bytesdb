        "ingredients": [
            "2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour",
            "1 teaspoon salt",
            "1 1/2 tablespoons granulated sugar",
            "2 sticks (16 tablespoons) unsalted butter, cut into small pieces and frozen for 15 minutes",
            "1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar, chilled"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "In the bowl of a food processor, pulse the flour, salt, and sugar. Add butter and pulse until coarse, pea-sized crumbs appear, about 10 seconds. With the machine running, add vinegar and 1/4 cup ice water and process until the dough just holds together, about 30 seconds. Squeeze a small amount of dough between your fingers and if it is very crumbly, add more ice water, 1 tablespoon at a time (2 tablespoons maximum). Do not over process. Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface and push together into a rough ball. Knead a few times to combine, then divide into two equal balls. Flatten each ball into a disc with smooth edges (no cracks), cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate at least 1 hour or up to overnight.",
