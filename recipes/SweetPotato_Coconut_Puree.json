        "ingredients": [
            "6 pounds medium sweet potatoes",
            "1 cup well-stirred canned unsweetened coconut milk",
            "3 tablespoons packed dark brown sugar, or to taste"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Preheat oven to 450\u00b0F with rack in middle. Prick sweet potatoes in several places with a fork, then bake on a foil-lined baking sheet, rotating potatoes halfway through baking, until very soft, 45 minutes to 1 hour. When cool enough to handle, halve sweet potatoes and scoop flesh into a bowl. Meanwhile, bring coconut milk, brown sugar, and 1 teaspoon salt just to a simmer in a small saucepan over medium heat, stirring occasionally. Stir into warm sweet potatoes, then pulse in batches in a food processor until smooth. Season with salt.",
