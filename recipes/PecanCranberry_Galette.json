            "Make the dough: Pulse flour, pecans, granulated sugar, cinnamon, and salt in a food processor until pecans are finely ground. Add butter and pulse until sandy. With the motor running, slowly pour in 1 Tbsp. cold water, then pulse until dough starts to clump together. Form into a ball with your hands. Tightly wrap in plastic and chill at least 1 hour or up to 2 days.",

            "Make the filling and assemble: Preheat oven to 350\u00b0F. Bring cranberries and whiskey to a boil in a small saucepan over medium heat (or microwave in a small heatproof bowl). Remove from heat and let sit 10 minutes. Strain cranberries through a fine-mesh sieve, discarding (or drinking) the booze. Whisk egg in a large bowl. Set aside about 1 tsp. beaten egg in a small bowl to use for brushing crust. Whisk brown sugar, butter, and salt into remaining egg in large bowl until smooth, then stir in cranberries and pecans. Let dough sit at room temperature 10 minutes. Roll out dough on a lightly floured work surface to an approximately 11\" round. Don\u2019t worry if your circle isn\u2019t perfect or the edges are cracked\u2014that\u2019s okay. Transfer to a parchment-lined rimmed baking sheet. Spoon filling onto center of dough, leaving a 2\" border. Fold dough up and over filling, overlapping slightly and using parchment to help lift the dough. Brush dough with reserved egg wash, then sprinkle generously with coarse sugar. Chill for 10 minutes. Bake galette until filling is puffed and set and crust is golden brown, 25\u201330 minutes. If some of the filling leaks out, don\u2019t worry\u2014just trim that off before serving. Let galette cool slightly. Serve with whipped cream.",
