Combine tomatoes (crushing them with your hands), garlic, anchovies, butter, and 1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes in a 13x9\" baking dish; season with salt and black pepper. Roast, tossing halfway through, until garlic is very soft and mixture is jammy, 35\u201340 minutes. Using a potato masher or fork, mash to break up garlic and tomatoes. Meanwhile, cook pasta in a large pot of boiling salted water, stirring occasionally, until al dente. Drain, reserving 1/2 cup pasta cooking liquid.

            "3 More Ideas for Roasted Tomato Sauce: You may never stir again once you've given this low-maintenance tomato sauce a try. Roasting coaxes depth from canned tomatoes, instilling a long-cooked flavor. A generous amount of garlic and anchovies adds even more character. Here are other ways to use the wonderful sauce beyond pasta: Tomato Soup: Pur\u00e9e with vegetable or chicken stock and a splash of cream for a warming bowl. Omelet: Fold a spoonful inside an omelet along with pieces of smoked mozzarella. Pizza: It is tomato sauce, after all. Spread it on pizza dough and shower with Parmesan. Bake and top with more anchovies, parsley, and lemon zest.",
