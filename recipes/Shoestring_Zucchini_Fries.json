        "ingredients": [
            "1 medium zucchini (6 oz), trimmed",
            "1/2 teaspoon salt",
            "1 garlic clove, halved lengthwise",
            "1/4 cup olive oil",
            "1 tablespoon all-purpose flour"

        "instructions": [
            "Halve zucchini crosswise, then cut each half lengthwise into 1/8-inch-wide slices and cut slices lengthwise into 1/8-inch-thick strips. Toss with salt in a large medium-mesh sieve set over a bowl and drain 30 minutes. Squeeze handfuls of zucchini to remove moisture, then roll up in a triple layer of paper towels and squeeze to remove remaining moisture. Cook garlic in oil in a 7- to 8-inch heavy skillet over moderately high heat, turning occasionally, until golden, 1 to 2 minutes. Discard garlic. While garlic is cooking, toss zucchini with flour in a small bowl, then add to oil and fry, turning occasionally with a slotted spoon, until zucchini is golden, 5 to 6 minutes. Transfer zucchini to paper towels to drain. Serve immediately.",
