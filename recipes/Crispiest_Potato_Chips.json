            "1/2 cup distilled white vinegar",

        "instructions": [
            "Slice 1 1/2 pounds russet or purple potatoes about 1/8\" thick (a mandoline helps). Place in a large bowl, add cold water to cover, and stir to release starch; drain. Repeat until water runs clear. Return potatoes to bowl; cover with 1/2 cup distilled white vinegar and 6 cups water. Let sit at least 30 minutes or up to 2 hours. Drain; pat dry.",
            "Fit a medium heavy pot with a deep-fry thermometer; pour in vegetable oil to measure 4\" (about 8 cups). Heat over medium-high until thermometer registers 300\u00b0F.",
            "Working in 6 batches and returning oil to 300\u00b0F between batches, fry potatoes, turning occasionally to cook evenly, until golden brown and crisp (oil will have quit bubbling), about 5 minutes per batch. Using a spider or slotted spoon, transfer to a paper towel-lined wire rack. Season with salt, or Nori Salt or Paprika Salt."
