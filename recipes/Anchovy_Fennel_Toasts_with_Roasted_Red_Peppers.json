        "title": "Anchovy Fennel Toasts with Roasted Red Peppers ",
        "ingredients": [
            "2 small red bell peppers (3/4 lb total)",
            "2 1/2 teaspoons fennel seeds",
            "1 stick (1/2 cup) unsalted butter, softened",
            "6 to 9 flat anchovy fillets (from a 2-oz can), patted dry and minced",
            "1 teaspoon fresh lemon juice",
            "1/2 teaspoon black pepper",
            "24 (1/4-inch-thick) diagonal slices of baguette",
            "an electric coffee/spice grinder or a mortar and pestle"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Roast bell peppers on racks of gas burners over high heat, turning with tongs, until skins are blackened, 10 to 12 minutes. Transfer to a large bowl and cover tightly with plastic wrap, then let steam, covered, about 20 minutes. When peppers are cool enough to handle, peel, then halve lengthwise, discarding stems and seeds. Cut peppers lengthwise into 3/4-inch-wide strips. Toast fennel seeds in a dry small heavy skillet over moderately low heat, shaking skillet frequently, until lightly browned, 3 to 4 minutes, then transfer to a bowl and cool. Finely grind fennel seeds in grinder, then stir into butter along with anchovies, lemon juice, and pepper until combined well. Preheat broiler. Broil baguette slices in a large shallow baking pan (18 by 12 inches) 3 to 4 inches from heat until golden, about 1 minute. Turn slices over and spread generously with anchovy butter. Broil toasts until butter is golden and bubbling, about 1 minute, then transfer to a platter. Top with bell pepper strips.",
