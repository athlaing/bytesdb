        "ingredients": [
            "1/2 cup unsalted butter",
            "1/2 tsp kosher salt plus more",
            "1 cup all-purpose flour",
            "5 eggs",
            "2 1/2 oz Gruy\u00e8re, grated",
            "4 oz andouille sausage, chopped"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Preheat oven to 425\u00b0 with racks in upper and lower thirds. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.",
            "In a large saucepan, combine 1 cup water, butter, and 1/2 tsp salt. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat. When butter has melted, add flour all at once, stirring vigorously with a wooden spoon. Reduce heat to medium; keep stirring until mixture has formed a smooth, thick paste and pulls away from sides of pan, about 3 minutes. Transfer to bowl of a stand mixer fitted with paddle attachment or to a large heatproof bowl.",
            "If using a stand mixer, add 4 eggs, 1 at a time, mixing on low speed until egg is incorporated and dough is smooth before adding the next egg.",
            "If mixing by hand, add 4 eggs, 1 at a time, stirring with a wooden spoon until egg is incorporated and dough is smooth before adding the next egg. The mixture should be very thick, smooth, and shiny. Stir in Gruy\u00e8re and andouille.",
            "Use a tablespoon measure to drop dough into 1\" rounds about 1 1/2\" apart on prepared baking sheets. You should have about 24 goug\u00e8res.",
            "In a small bowl, whisk remaining egg with a pinch of salt. Brush the top of each goug\u00e8re with egg wash.",
            "Bake for 15 minutes. Reduce oven to 375\u00b0, rotate baking sheets, and continue baking until goug\u00e8res are puffed and browned, about 15 minutes more. Serve warm or at room temperature."
