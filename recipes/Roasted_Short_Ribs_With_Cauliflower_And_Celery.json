            "For the short ribs: Place racks in upper and lower thirds of oven and preheat to 275\u00b0F.

            "For the salad and assembly: While the ribs and cauliflower are cooking, scatter hazelnuts on a rimmed baking sheet and toast on bottom rack, tossing once, until golden brown, 30\u201335 minutes. Let cool, then rub together in a kitchen towel to remove skins, if using skin-on nuts. Coarsely chop and set aside. Increase oven temperature to 450\u00b0F. Uncover ribs and return to oven, placing on top rack. Roast, basting with fat from skillet every couple of minutes, until a deep brown crust develops, 12\u201315 minutes. Toss celery, celery leaves, parsley, and reserved hazelnuts in a medium bowl to combine. Drizzle with oil and vinegar and toss to coat; season celery salad with salt and pepper.
