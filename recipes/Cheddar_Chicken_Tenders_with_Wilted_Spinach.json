            "Put oven rack in lower third of oven and preheat oven to 475\u00b0F. Brush a large shallow baking pan with oil (2 tablespoons). Pulse crackers in a food processor until finely ground, then transfer to a wide shallow bowl and stir in 1/2 teaspoon pepper. Toss tenders with mustard in a large bowl until coated, then dredge, 2 at a time, in cracker crumbs until evenly coated. Arrange tenders in 1 layer, without crowding, in oiled pan. Bake, turning over once, until golden brown, about 15 minutes total. Meanwhile, melt butter in a 5- to 6-quart heavy pot over moderate heat, then cook spinach, covered, turning with tongs, until spinach is just wilted, about 2 minutes. Stir in salt and remaining 1/4 teaspoon pepper, then serve spinach with chicken.",
