        "instructions": [
            "Using a sharp knife, score pork belly fat in a crosshatch pattern at about 3/4\" intervals, taking care not to cut into meat. Mix thyme, sugar, salt, and pepper in a small bowl. Rub thyme mixture on both sides of pork. Place pork in a large resealable plastic bag, seal bag, and chill at least 8 hours and up to 1 day. Preheat oven to 250\u00b0F. Arrange onion in bottom of a large heavy pot with a lid. Rinse pork and place fat side up on top of onion; add wine. Cover pot; place in oven and braise pork, basting occasionally, until fork-tender, 2 1/2-3 hours. Increase oven temperature to 400\u00b0F. Uncover pot and cook until meat is very tender and fat is crisp and golden brown, about 1 hour longer. Slice pork and serve with Gingery Rhubarb Compote. DO AHEAD: Pork belly can be made 2 days ahead (do not slice). Let cool slightly, then chill uncovered until cold. Cover and keep chilled. Preheat oven to 350\u00b0F. Reheat until hot and fat is crisp, 20-30 minutes.",
