Freeze 30 minutes.",

            "Bake the crisp: Meanwhile, preheat oven to 350\u00b0F. Place baking dish on a foil-lined rimmed baking sheet (if using a Dutch oven, you don't need the baking sheet). Toss apple mixture again, then transfer to baking dish, leaving some juices behind. Break crumble into smaller pieces, leaving some larger clumps. Top apples with crumble, mounding slightly if needed. Bake apple crisp until crumble is golden brown and filling is bubbling through in the center, about 1 hour. Transfer baking dish to a wire rack and let cool 10 minutes. Serve warm with whipped cream or ice cream topped with almonds.",
