        "ingredients": [
            "2 pounds small Yukon gold potatoes",
            "1/4 cup olive oil",
            "Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Place a rack in the lowest position in your oven and preheat to 425\u00b0F. Halve potatoes lengthwise.",
            "Arrange potatoes, cut side down, on a large rimmed baking sheet, spacing evenly. Pour in 1 1/2 to 2 cups water\u2014enough to cover the surface in a thin layer but not so much that it spills the second you move the sheet.",
            "Cover baking sheet with a double layer of foil, crimping sides very tightly to seal well. This will trap in steam and prevent water from sloshing out if you accidentally jostle the sheet.",
            "Bake until a fork or a skewer slides easily through the potatoes, 25 to 30 minutes. The foil will be puffed; pierce it with the fork or skewer and poke around for a couple of potatoes to test.",
            "Let potatos cool, still covered, 5 minutes. Use tongs to peel back foil about 1 inch at on corner. Carefully tip sheet and pour off water (its job is done). Crank up oven to 500\u00b0F or as high as it goes.",
            "Remove foil. Drizzle olive oil over potatoes. Season generously with kosher salt and freshly ground pepper. Let potatoes cool to the point that you can handle them, then toss to coat.",
            "Arrange potatoes cut side down and roast, uncovered, until skins are golden, cut sides are deeply browned and crisp, and you can see the edges frying and sizzling in the oil on the sheet, 20\u201325 minutes.",
            "Let potatoes cool for a minute or two, then use a spatula to unstick them from the baking sheet. Serve them exactly as they are because these potatoes need absolutely nothing else."
