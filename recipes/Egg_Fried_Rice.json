            "1 tablespoon peanut oil",
            "4 large eggs, lightly beaten",
            "4 cups cold unsalted steamed white rice",
            "3/4 teaspoon salt",
            "1/2 cup thinly sliced scallion greens (3 to 4 scallions)",

        "instructions": [
            "Heat wok over high heat until a drop of water vaporizes instantly upon contact. Add peanut oil, swirling to coat wok evenly, and heat until hot and just smoking. Add eggs, tilting wok and swirling eggs to form a thin even layer on cooking surface, and cook 30 seconds, then add rice and salt and stir-fry, breaking up eggs and letting rice rest several seconds between stirs, until rice is hot, 2 to 3 minutes. Add scallion greens and sesame oil (to taste) and stir-fry until combined well."
