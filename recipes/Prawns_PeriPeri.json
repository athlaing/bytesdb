            "18-24 large prawns (large shrimp)",
            "200 g (3/4 cup) butter",
            "10 ml (2 teaspoons) crushed garlic",
            "30 ml (2 tablespoons) lemon juice",
            "30 ml (2 tablespoons) peri-peri sauce (recipe below)",
            "salt, milled black pepper",
            "50 g (1 1/2 ounces) red chillies, very finely chopped",
            "5 cloves garlic, crushed",
            "500 ml (2 cups) olive oil",

        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Mix the ingredients together in a bottle and shake well. You can make the sauce ahead and store it in the fridge; the flavour improves with age, reaching its peak at two weeks.",
            "Slit prawns down their backs and devein. Leave heads on, or remove them if you prefer. Depending on the size of your frying pan, cook them in one or two batches.",
            "Heat the butter gently and add the garlic and lemon juice. Don't let the garlic burn. Add prawns and peri-peri sauce. (Shake first to make sure you get some of the chilli and garlic as well.)",
            "Sizzle for 4-5 minutes, turning frequently, until cooked. Season with salt and pepper and tip into a warm serving bowl. Garnish, if you wish, with chopped fresh parsley. Serve with rice or bread and butter."
