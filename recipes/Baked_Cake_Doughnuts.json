        "ingredients": [
            "3/4 cup plus 1 tablespoon (120 grams) all-purpose flour",
            "1/4 cup (30 grams) whole wheat pastry flour",
            "1 teaspoon baking powder",
            "1/3 cup (75 grams) superfine sugar",
            "1/2 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg",
            "1/2 teaspoon salt",
            "2 tablespoons (1 ounce) unsalted butter or vegetable shortening",
            "1/4 cup whole milk, scalded",
            "1/4 cup plain yogurt",
            "1 teaspoon vanilla extract",

        ],
        "instructions": [
            "1. Preheat the oven to 350\u00b0F. Lightly grease a doughnut pan.",
            "2. Sift the flours and baking powder together into a large bowl or the bowl of a mixer. Whisk in the sugar, nutmeg, and salt. Add the butter and use your fingers to rub it into the dry ingredients as you would in making a pastry crust, until evenly distributed. Add the milk, yogurt, vanilla, and egg and stir until just combined. Do not overmix or your doughnuts may be rubbery.",
            "3. Use a piping bag or a spoon to fill each doughnut cup about three-quarters full, making sure the center post is clear. Bake until doughnuts are a light golden brown and spring back when touched, 6 to 10 minutes. Let cool slightly before removing from pan. Glaze as desired."
