Reduce heat and simmer, swirling pan occasionally and being careful not to let mixture boil over, until cream is slightly thickened, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in lime juice. Strain mixture through a fine-mesh sieve into a large measuring glass; divide among 4 small glasses, bowls, or 8-oz. ramekins. Chill until custards are no longer warm, about 30 minutes, then cover with plastic wrap and continue to chill until set, at least 2 hours.",
