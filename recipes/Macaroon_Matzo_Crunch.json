        "ingredients": [
            "1/2 cup unsweetened coconut flakes",
            "1/2 cup sliced almonds",
            "Nonstick vegetable cooking spray",
            "4 unsalted matzo crackers",
            "3/4 cup (1 1/2 sticks) unsalted butter or unsalted pareve margarine",
            "1 cup (packed) light brown sugar",
            "1 teaspoon vanilla extract",
            "1/4 teaspoon kosher salt",
            "5 ounces chopped semisweet chocolate or chocolate chips (about 3/4 cup)"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Preheat oven to 350\u00b0F. Spread coconut flakes on 1 baking sheet and almonds on another. Toast until golden brown, about 3 minutes for the coconut and about 7 minutes for the almonds. Set aside. Meanwhile, line a large rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper and spray with nonstick spray. Arrange matzo on parchment with no gaps in between (it's ok if they overlap slightly). Whisk together butter, brown sugar, vanilla, and salt in a medium pot. Whisking occasionally, bring to a high simmer over medium heat, about 3 minutes. Once mixture is simmering, whisk constantly, until it turns a light brown, thickens, and starts to pull away from the sides of the pot, about 3 minutes. Immediately pour onto matzo, covering completely. Using a spatula, quickly spread caramel so matzo has an even coating. Bake matzo until caramel is golden brown and bubbling, 14-16 minutes. Watch carefully to make sure caramel doesn't burn. If it starts to darken too quickly, remove from oven and lower heat to 325\u00b0F; return to oven after a few minutes and continue to bake, watching closely. Meanwhile, place chocolate in a heatproof bowl set over a small pot of simmering water and stir occasionally until melted. (Or, place chocolate in a microwave-safe bowl and heat in 20-second bursts in the microwave, stirring between each burst, until melted.) Remove matzo from oven and sprinkle immediately with reserved coconut and almonds. Drizzle with chocolate. Let cool slightly, then place the baking sheet with the matzo crunch in the refrigerator until cooled and set, at least 30 minutes or up to overnight. Break matzo crunch into pieces and serve.",
