            "1 ounce gin",

        "instructions": [
            "In a small pot, combine 20 sage leaves, sugar, and 1 cup of water. Bring to a boil then lower heat to moderately low and simmer until aromatic and slightly thickened, about 10 minutes. Allow syrup to cool, then pour through a fine-mesh sieve and discard the sage. DO AHEAD: The sage simple syrup can be made in advance and stored, in an airtight container in the refrigerator, up to 1 week",
            "In a cocktail shaker, combine 3/4 ounce sage simple syrup with the gin, Cocchi Aperitivo Americano, and lime juice. Fill the shaker with ice and shake vigorously until completely mixed, about 20 seconds. Strain into a chilled champagne coupe, then slowly add the Campari so that it settles at the bottom of the glass. Garnish with a fresh sage leaf."
