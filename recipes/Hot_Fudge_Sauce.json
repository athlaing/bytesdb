            "Finely chop chocolate. In a small heavy saucepan heat evaporated milk and sugar over moderate heat, stirring, until sugar is dissolved. Add chocolate, butter, and corn syrup to milk mixture and continue to cook, stirring constantly, just until smooth. Bring mixture to a boil over moderate heat, stirring occasionally, and gently boil 8 minutes. Remove pan from heat and stir in vanilla and salt. Fudge sauce keeps, covered and chilled, 3 weeks. Cool fudge sauce completely before covering (any condensation will make it grainy). Reheat fudge sauce, uncovered, over simmering water in a double boiler.",
