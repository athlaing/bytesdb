        "instructions": [
            "1. Preheat the oven to 350\u00b0F. 2. In a standing electric mixer, use the whisk attachment to whip the egg whites with the cream of tartar. When they start to double in size, slowly add in 2/3 cup of the sugar. Whip until you have stiff peaks. Set aside. 3. In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the egg yolks, salt, and the remaining 2/3 cup sugar. Gradually add the orange juice and continue to beat until light and fluffy. 4. Combine the two mixtures: Spoon a little whipped egg whites into the yolks and stir. Then fold the rest of the whites into the mixture in two additions. 5. Deftly fold in the flour, vanilla extract, and almond extract. 6. Pour the batter into an ungreased 9-inch angel food cake pan and bake for 35 to 40 minutes or until a cake tester comes out clean. 7. Remove the pan from the oven and place it upside down. Leave it like that until the cake is cool. 8. Once it has cooled, run a sharp knife around the edge of the cake to separate it from the pan. Invert the pan over a serving plate, and let gravity do its thing. 9. Carefully cut the cake in half horizontally with a large serrated knife. 10. Frost the top of the bottom half with some of the orange filling (see below), and then layer some of the mandarin orange slices and berries on top of the frosting. 11. Place the top half over the bottom half, and then frost the top and sides of the cake with the remaining orange filling. Place the remaining mandarin oranges and berries on top of the cake. 12. Sprinkle the topping (see below) over the cake and enjoy.",
