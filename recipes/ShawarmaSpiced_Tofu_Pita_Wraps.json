            "1 (14-oz.) block firm or extra-firm tofu, drained",
            "3 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil",
            "2 tsp. ground coriander",
            "2 tsp. smoked Spanish paprika",
            "1/2 tsp. crushed red pepper flakes",
            "1/2 tsp. ground cinnamon",
            "1 tsp. kosher salt, plus more",
            "1/2 cup whole-milk Greek yogurt",

        "instructions": [
            "Preheat oven to 425\u00b0F. Toss onion and vinegar in a small bowl to coat; set aside.",
            "Squeeze tofu over a medium bowl, gently at first, then more firmly to expel as much water as possible (like squeezing out a big sponge). Don\u2019t worry if it starts to crack apart. When no more liquid comes out, tear tofu into 1\" pieces. Arrange in a single layer on a large rimmed baking sheet. Toss with oil, then add coriander, paprika, red pepper flakes, cinnamon, and 1 tsp. salt. Toss well to coat. Roast tofu, turning once or twice, until crispy around the edges and well browned, 20\u201325 minutes (the tofu will get crispier as it cools, so don\u2019t be tempted to take it too far and dry it out in the oven).",
            "Stir yogurt and garlic in a small bowl; season with salt. Assemble by dividing yogurt among pitas, followed by tofu, cucumbers, drained pickled onion, and a handful of mint."
