        "ingredients": [
            "One 16-ounce can refried beans (I opt for mild rather than spicy for late-night fare)",
            "1/2 cup reduced-fat or regular sour cream",
            "3/4 cup bottled salsa",
            "1 cup shredded Cheddar or Mexican Blend cheese",
            "2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro, plus more for garnish",
            "A few big handfuls of yellow corn tortilla chips"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "With a large spoon spread out the beans in a ring on a large microwave-safe dinner plate, leaving clear about 4 inches in the center of the plate. That's where you're going to pile the chips. Smear the sour cream and then the salsa over the beans. Sprinkle about half of the cheese and then the cilantro over everything. As you build up the layers, be sure to leave the space in the center of the plate empty.",
            "Microwave on high for 2 minutes. Remove the plate from the microwave, pile the chips in the center of the plate, and sprinkle the remaining cheese over the chips. Return the plate to the microwave and nuke again on high for 1 minute, until the cheese has melted. Use a pot holder to take the plate out of the oven; it will be hot. Dash with a couple pinches of chopped cilantro. Serve hot."
