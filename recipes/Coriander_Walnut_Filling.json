            "Preheat oven to 350\u00b0F. In a baking pan toast walnuts in one layer in middle of oven 10 to 15 minutes, or until lightly colored, and cool completely. Mince garlic and discard stems from spinach. Have ready a large bowl of ice and cold water. In a 3-quart kettle half filled with boiling salted water blanch spinach 20 seconds and with a slotted skimmer transfer to ice water to stop cooking. Return water to a boil and blanch fresh coriander and parsley 5 seconds. Drain herbs in a colander and transfer to ice water to stop cooking. Drain spinach and herbs in colander and squeeze in small handfuls until as dry as possible. In a food processor pulse walnuts just until finely ground. Add garlic, spinach mixture, and remaining ingredients and pulse just until smooth. (Filling may be made 2 days ahead and chilled, covered.)",
