Gradually add 1 cup sugar and beat until stiff but not dry. Using same beaters, beat egg yolks and remaining 1/3 cup sugar in another bowl until mixture is thick and slowly dissolving ribbon forms when beaters are lifted. At low speed, beat in nondairy creamer, then margarine, lemon peel and lemon juice. Add dry ingredients and stir until well blended. Fold in egg whites in 2 additions. Pour half of batter into prepared pan. Sprinkle baked streusel over. Sprinkle with half of raisins. Spread remaining cake batter over. Sprinkle with unbaked streusel and remaining raisins.
