            "1 cup (6 ounces) semisweet chocolate chips",
            "2 1/2 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into bits",
            "1 large egg",
            "1/4 cup sugar",
            "1/2 teaspoon vanilla",
            "2 tablespoons all-purpose flour",
            "1/2 cup chopped walnuts",

        "instructions": [
            "Butter and flour an 8-inch round cake pan. In a small metal bowl set over barely simmering water melt 3/4 cup of the chocolate chips and the butter, stirring until the mixture is smooth. In a bowl whisk together the egg, the sugar, and the vanilla until the mixture is foamy, whisk in the chocolate mixture and a pinch of salt, whisking until the mixture is smooth, and fold in the flour, the remaining 1/4 cup chocolate chips, and the walnuts. Spoon the batter into the pan, spreading it evenly, and bake the torte in the middle of a preheated 350\u00b0F oven for 15 to 20 minutes, or until a tester comes out clean. Transfer the torte to a rack, let it cool for 10 minutes, and serve it warm, cut into wedges, with the ice cream."
