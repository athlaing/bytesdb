Cook onion with bay leaf and juniper berries in butter in a 12-inch heavy skillet over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until well browned, 8 to 10 minutes. Add sauerkraut and cook, stirring occasionally, until heated through and liquid has evaporated, about 2 minutes. Discard bay leaf. Meanwhile, remove skin and bones from duck legs, reserving skin and discarding bones. Tear meat into 1-inch pieces and stir into sauerkraut. Transfer to baking dish. Whisk together cream, milk, eggs, nutmeg, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper, then pour over sauerkraut. Bake until custard is set and edges are lightly browned, 45 to 50 minutes. Meanwhile, remove skin and bones from duck legs, reserving skin and discarding bones. Tear meat into 1-inch pieces and stir into sauerkraut. Transfer to baking dish.
