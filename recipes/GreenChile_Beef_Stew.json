            "3 lb boneless beef chuck, trimmed and cut into 1 1/2-inch pieces",

            "2 tablespoons vegetable oil",
            "2 large white onions, chopped (4 to 5 cups)",
            "3 garlic cloves, finely chopped (about 1 tablespoon)",
            "1 tablespoon ground cumin",
            "1 (28-oz) can whole tomatoes in juice",
            "2 to 2 1/2 cups water",

        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Pat beef dry and season with pepper and 1 teaspoon salt. Heat oil in a 10- to 11-inch-wide (5- to 7-quart) heavy pot over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking, then cook beef in 2 or 3 batches, turning occasionally, until browned, 6 to 8 minutes per batch. Transfer as browned to a bowl using a slotted spoon. Add onion and garlic to fat in pot and cook over moderately high heat, stirring and scraping up brown bits, until softened, about 8 minutes. Add cumin and remaining teaspoon salt and cook, stirring, 2 minutes. Return beef (with any juices accumulated in bowl) to pot and stir in tomatoes with juice and enough water to cover meat, then bring to a simmer. Discard seeds, ribs, and stems from chiles, then cut lengthwise into 1/3-inch-wide strips. Add chiles to stew and gently simmer, uncovered, stirring occasionally to break up tomatoes, until meat is very tender, about 3 hours.",
