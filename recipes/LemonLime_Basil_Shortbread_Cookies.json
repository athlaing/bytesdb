Measure level tablespoonfuls of dough; roll between your palms to form balls. Place on a large baking sheet, spacing 2\" apart. Lightly dust the bottom of a flat measuring cup with powdered sugar and press cookies into 2\" rounds, dusting cup bottom with powdered sugar as needed to prevent sticking.
