            "Preheat oven to 400\u00b0F. Mix chili powder, garlic, and salt in small bowl; rub mixture into ribs. Place ribs on large rimmed baking sheet, meaty side up. Bake ribs 50 minutes.",
            "Meanwhile, puree remaining ingredients in blender until almost smooth. Strain blackberry puree into heavy medium saucepan; discard solids in sieve. Cook puree over medium-high heat until reduced to 1 cup, stirring frequently, about 5 minutes. Season sauce to taste with salt and pepper.",
