            "What to drink: With this menu, try a bottle of Riesling. We particularly like the Smith-Madrone 2007 Riesling from Napa Valley ($25). The mango, pineapple, and citrus flavors of the wine are the perfect complement to this meal. While you're at the market, look for a Thai beer like Singha, which is produced by Thailand's first and largest brewery.",
