        "ingredients": [
            "1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, softened, divided",
            "4 hot dog buns, preferably split top",
            "1 teaspoon Old Bay seasoning",
            "1 pound good-quality fresh crabmeat, picked over",
            "1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce",
            "2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice",
            "1/4 teaspoon kosher salt",
            "1 tablespoon sliced chives",
            "Lemon wedges (for serving)"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Heat a medium skillet over medium. Spread 2 Tbsp. butter on cut sides of each bun. Toast buns, cut side down, working in batches if necessary, until golden brown, about 2 minutes per batch. Set buns aside and wipe out skillet.",
            "Melt remaining 6 Tbsp. butter in same skillet over medium heat. Continue to cook until butter foams, smells nutty, and turns caramel-colored, about 5 minutes. Add Old Bay seasoning, then gently fold in crabmeat and Worcestershire (mixture might spatter). Cook, stirring occasionally, until crabmeat is heated through, about 3 minutes. Remove from heat; stir in lemon juice and salt.",
            "Using a slotted spoon, transfer crab mixture to buns and top with chives. Serve with lemon wedges alongside."
