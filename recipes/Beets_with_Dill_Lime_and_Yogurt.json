        "title": "Beets with Dill, Lime, and Yogurt ",
        "ingredients": [
            "6 medium beets (about 1 1/2 pounds)",
            "1 lime",
            "Extra-virgin olive oil, for drizzling",
            "1 cup plain whole-milk yogurt",
            "1 garlic clove, grated on a Microplane or minced",
            "Pinch of fine sea salt",
            "2 tablespoons chopped fresh dill",
            "Flaky sea salt, for garnish",
            "Freshly ground black pepper, for garnish"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Remove any greens and scrub the beets under warm water.",
            "Pour 1 1/2 cups of water into the pressure cooker pot. Insert the steamer basket and put the 6 beets in the basket. Cook on high pressure for 30 minutes. Release the pressure manually. Test the beets by piercing them with a fork; they should be tender. If not, cook on high pressure again for another 5 to 10 minutes.",
            "Meanwhile, grate the zest off the lime and reserve it; then cut the lime into wedges.",
            "When the beets are tender, transfer them to a large bowl and let them cool until you\u2019re comfortable handling them. Working quickly, skin the beets while they are still warm (they are harder to peel after they\u2019ve entirely cooled down). You can use a paring knife to skin them, or rub the skins off with a paper towel.",
            "Cut the peeled beets into slices or wedges, and arrange them on a platter. Drizzle with olive oil, and then squeeze some of the fresh lime juice over them.",
            "In a small bowl, whisk together the yogurt, garlic, and reserved lime zest. Drizzle the dressing over the beets and top with the dill, flaky sea salt, and lots of black pepper."
