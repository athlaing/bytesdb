        "ingredients": [
            "2 whole skinless boneless chicken breasts (about 1 1/4 pounds)",
            "about thirty-two 7-inch bamboo skewers, soaked in water to cover for 15 minutes",
            "3/4 cup sweetened flaked coconut",
            "2 teaspoons chopped peeled fresh gingerroot",
            "2 teaspoons curry powder",
            "2 tablespoons fresh lime juice",
            "1/2 cup hot water",
            "Dipping Sauce"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Cut the chicken lengthwise into 1/4-inch-thick slices, thread the slices lengthwise onto the skewers, and season them with salt and pepper.",
            "Make the marinade: In a blender blend together the coconut, the gingerroot, the curry powder, the lime juice, and the hot water until the mixture is smooth, strain the mixture through a fine sieve into a bowl, pressing hard on the solids, and let the marinade cool. The marinade may be made 2 days in advance and kept covered and chilled. In a large shallow dish pour the marinade over the chicken, coating the chicken well, and let the chicken marinate, covered and chilled, for at least 1 hour and up to 3 hours. (Do not let the chicken marinate longer or the meat will break down.) Make the dipping sauce. Grill the chicken with the marinade clinging to it on an oiled rack set 5 to 6 inches over glowing coals for 1 1/2 minutes on each side, or until it is cooked through, and serve the sat\u00e9s with the dipping sauce.",
