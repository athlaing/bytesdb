            "Bring two 16-ounce packages frozen peaches, 3/4 cup sugar, and a pinch of kosher salt to a boil in a medium saucepan. Reduce heat and simmer gently, mashing fruit occasionally with a spoon, until peaches are very tender, 40-45 minutes. Strain into a jar, pressing gently on solids (press too hard and syrup will be cloudy). Cover; chill at least 1 hour and up to 2 weeks."
