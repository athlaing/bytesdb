            "Preheat oven to 350\u00b0F. Toast pine nuts, sunflower seeds, almonds, sesame seeds, and fennel seeds on a rimmed baking sheet, tossing occasionally, until lightly golden, 5\u20137 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 275\u00b0F. Meanwhile, whisk honey, peanut butter, oil, orange zest and juice, and vanilla in a medium bowl until smooth. Toss nuts and seeds, oats, and salt in a large bowl. Pour honey mixture over and gently mix until oat mixture is completely coated. Spread out on a parchment-lined rimmed baking sheet and bake, stirring halfway through (edges will take on color before center does), until golden brown, 20\u201325 minutes. Let cool; granola will crisp as it cools. Break up into pieces, then stir in apricots and cranberries.",
