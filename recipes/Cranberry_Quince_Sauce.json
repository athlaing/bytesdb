            "1 3/4 lb quinces (2 large)",
            "4 cups water",
            "1 1/2 cups sugar",
            "1 (12-oz) bag fresh or frozen cranberries (do not thaw; 3 1/2 cups)",

        "instructions": [
            "Peel, quarter, and core quinces, reserving peel and cores, then cut quarters into 1/4-inch pieces. Tie up peel and cores in cheesecloth. Bring water and sugar to a boil in a 4-quart heavy saucepan, stirring until sugar is dissolved, then add quince and cheesecloth bundle and simmer, partially covered, until quince is tender, about 1 1/2 hours. Add cranberries and simmer, uncovered, stirring occasionally, until cranberries burst and soften, 8 to 10 minutes.",

Stir together syrup and cranberry mixture in bowl, then cool to room temperature."
