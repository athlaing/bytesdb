        "title": "Crispy Fried Shallots ",
        "ingredients": [
            "2 cups thinly sliced shallots (about 4 large shallots)",
            "2 cups canola oil"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "1. In a small saucepan, heat the oil over medium-high until it registers 275\u00b0F on a deep-fry thermometer. Add the shallots and cook, stirring, until light golden brown, about 8 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the shallots to a paper towel-lined plate to drain.",
            "2. Increase the heat to high and place a fine-mesh sieve over a heatproof bowl. When the oil registers 350\u00b0F on the deep-fry thermometer, add the once fried shallots and cook just until they are crispy and well-browned, about 1-2 seconds, watching carefully so the shallots don't burn.",
            "3. Immediately pour the oil and shallots through the sieve to stop the cooking, then transfer to shallots to a paper towel-lined plate to drain. Reserve the oil for another use. The shallots will keep, stored in an airtight container, for 1 day, but they're best the day they are made."
