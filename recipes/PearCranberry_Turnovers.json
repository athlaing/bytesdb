Top with second sheet; brush with butter. Fold phyllo in half lengthwise, forming 17-inch- long strip. Place scant 1/2 cup pear mixture on phyllo strip, about 2 inches in from 1 short side and in center. Fold 1 corner of strip over pear mixture, then fold phyllo back and forth (like a flag), enclosing filling. Brush top with butter after each fold until entire strip is folded, forming triangle.",
