            "1/2 cup whole milk",
            "2 large eggs",
            "1/3 cup cornstarch",
            "1 quart half-and-half",
            "1 cup sugar",
            "1/4 cup dried Thai tea mix*",

        "instructions": [
            "Whisk the milk, eggs, and cornstarch together in a medium mixing bowl.",
            "Combine the half-and-half, sugar, Thai tea mix, and salt in a medium saucepan, and bring to a boil over medium-high heat, 5 to 6 minutes. Pour the mixture through a fine-mesh strainer into a bowl, and then slowly whisk it into the egg mixture until well incorporated.",
            "Wash the saucepan and then return it to the stove. Pour the tea-egg mixture back into the pan and cook over medium-low heat, whisking constantly and scraping the sides and bottom of the pan so that the ingredients don't stick and burn, until the mixture is noticeably thicker, 5 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat and pour the pudding into 6 dessert cups. Chill in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours before serving.",
            "Serve topped with the lime caramel, candied cashews, and lime whipped cream."
