            "3 1/2 oz (100g) dark chocolate (72% cacao), chopped",

        "instructions": [
            "Preheat the oven to 350\u00b0F (180\u00b0C). Turn the hazelnuts out onto a baking sheet and toast in the preheated oven for about 5-7 minutes, until pale golden. Remove the nuts from the oven and cool slightly. Put the warm hazelnuts into a food processor and chop until they become an almost smooth paste.",
            "Gently melt the chocolate, condensed milk, and hazelnut oil in a small saucepan over low heat. Stir until smooth and add to the hazelnut paste in the food processor. Add a pinch of salt and blend, then add the hot water and blend again until the mixture has a thick, spreadable consistency.",
            "Spoon into a pretty sterilized jar and let cool. Cover with a lid and label when cold."
