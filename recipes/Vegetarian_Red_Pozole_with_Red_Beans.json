            "Transfer chiles with tongs to a blender (discard soaking water) and add garlic, cider vinegar, cumin, oregano, 1/2 teaspoon salt, sugar, cloves, and 1 cup water. Blend until smooth, about 1 minute.",
            "Add chile pur\u00e9e to pot and cook, stirring, 5 minutes.",
            "Add remaining 5 cups water, hominy, beans, zucchini, corn, and 1/2 teaspoon each salt and pepper and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer, partially covered, stirring occasionally, until zucchini is tender, about 20 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper.",
