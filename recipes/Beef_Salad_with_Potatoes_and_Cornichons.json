        "ingredients": [
            "2 large boiling potatoes (1 pound total)",
            "3 cups shredded wine-braised chuck roast",
            "3 tablespoons red-wine vinegar",
            "1 1/2 tablespoons Dijon mustard",
            "1/4 cup finely chopped shallots (about 2)",
            "3/4 teaspoon sugar",
            "1 teaspoon salt",
            "1/4 teaspoon black pepper",
            "5 tablespoons mild olive or vegetable oil",
            "1/2 pound haricots verts or regular green beans, trimmed and halved diagonally",
            "1 large head Bibb lettuce",
            "6 cornichons (French sour gherkins), cut lengthwise into 1/8-inch-thick matchsticks",
            "1/4 cup chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Put oven rack in middle position and preheat oven to 400\u00b0F.",
            "Place potatoes on a 12-inch square of foil, then prick each with a fork and wrap in foil. Bake until tender, about 1 hour. (Potatoes are done when a small knife pierces centers easily.) Unwrap potatoes and cool slightly.",
            "Assemble salad: Reheat beef in a small baking dish, covered, in oven or in microwave until warm. While beef is heating, whisk together vinegar, mustard, shallots, sugar, salt, and pepper in a small bowl, then add oil in a slow stream, whisking until dressing is emulsified. Steam beans in a steamer set over boiling water, covered, until just tender, about 5 minutes. Meanwhile, peel potatoes and cut crosswise into 1/4-inch-thick slices, transferring to a large bowl. Add hot beans to warm potatoes along with 2 tablespoons vinaigrette, gently tossing to coat. Line a platter or 4 plates with lettuce leaves and arrange potato mixture on top. Toss meat, cornichons, and parsley with remaining vinaigrette and mound on top of potato mixture.",
