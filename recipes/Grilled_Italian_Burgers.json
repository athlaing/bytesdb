Grill burgers, onions and peppers until burgers are cooked through and onions and peppers are lightly charred, turning occasionally, about 10 minutes. Move peppers and onions to cool side of grill. Top burgers with cheese. Place rolls on grill cut side down. Cover with lid and cook until cheese melts and buns are heated through, about 2 minutes. Transfer buns to plates.
