            "2 teaspoons vanilla extract",
            "2 cups (packed) dark brown sugar",
            "1 14-ounce can sweetened condensed milk",
            "3/4 cup whipping cream",
            "6 tablespoons (3/4 stick) unsalted butter",
            "1/4 teaspoon salt",

        "instructions": [
            "Line 11x7-inch metal baking pan with foil, overlapping sides by 3 inches. Combine first 4 ingredients in large bowl. Stir sugar, condensed milk, cream, butter, and salt in heavy medium saucepan over medium-low heat until sugar dissolves (no granules will remain when drop of mixture is rubbed between fingertips), occasionally brushing down sides of pan with wet pastry brush, about 10 minutes. Attach clip-on candy thermometer to side of pan. Increase heat to high and bring mixture to boil. Reduce heat to medium-high and stir constantly but slowly with wooden spatula until thermometer registers 230\u00b0F, about 15 minutes. Immediately pour mixture over ingredients in bowl (do not scrape pan). Stir mixture vigorously with wooden spoon until chocolate melts and fudge thickens slightly, about 1 minute. Transfer mixture to prepared baking pan; smooth top of fudge with rubber spatula. Sprinkle fudge with chocolate chips. Refrigerate fudge until firm enough to cut, about 2 hours. Using foil as aid, lift fudge from pan. Fold down foil sides. Trim edges of fudge to even. Cut into 40 squares or 3 large wide bars. Place fudge squares in candy cups, if desired. (Can be made 2 weeks ahead. Chill in airtight container. Let stand at room temperature at least 30 minutes and up to 1 hour before serving.)",
