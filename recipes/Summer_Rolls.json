        "instructions": [
            "Boil noodles in salted water for 3 minutes; drain; set aside. Combine turkey, egg whites, scallions, mushrooms, fish sauce, oyster sauce, sugar and black pepper in a bowl. Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat; cook turkey mixture, stirring, until dry and crumbly, about 7 minutes. Remove from heat. Push meat to one side; place pepper strips in pan. Fill a bowl with warm water. Soak 1 piece rice paper until pliable, but not entirely soft, 10 to 15 seconds. Lay flat on a cutting board. Place 2 bell pepper strips across wrapper 2 inches from bottom. On top of strips, layer 1/2 cup turkey mixture, 1/8 of mung beans, 1/8 of noodles and 1/8 of pepper strips to form a log-shaped pile. Fold bottom edge of wrapper up and sides in against filling. Roll up to top edge. Repeat with remaining ingredients. Cut in half on bias."
