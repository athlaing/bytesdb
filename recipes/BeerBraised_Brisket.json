        "instructions": [
            "Finely chop garlic in a food processor. Add brown sugar, mustard, oil, black pepper, cumin, paprika, cayenne, and 1/4 cup salt and process until smooth. Rub all over brisket, working into crevices. Wrap in plastic; chill 1\u20132 days. Let meat sit out until room temperature, about 1 hour.",
            "Preheat oven to 325\u00b0. Scatter onions in a large roasting pan and set brisket, fat side up, on top. Add beer; cover with foil. Braise until meat is very tender, 5\u20136 hours. Remove from oven; heat broiler. Broil brisket, uncovered, until top is browned and crisp, 5\u201310 minutes.",
            "Let brisket cool slightly. Remove from pan and shred or slice. Remove onions with a slotted spoon; mix into brisket. Taste and moisten with some cooking liquid and season with salt, if needed.",
            "Do ahead: Brisket can be braised 1 day ahead. Let cool; cover and chill. Reheat, covered, at 325\u00b0 for 1 1/2 hours."
