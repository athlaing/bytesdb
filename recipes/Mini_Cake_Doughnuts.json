        "ingredients": [
            "1/2 cup (60 grams) white spelt or all-purpose flour",
            "1/4 cup (30 grams) rye flour or whole-wheat flour",
            "1/4 cup (30 grams) barley flour or all-purpose flour",
            "1 teaspoon baking powder",
            "1/3 cup (66 grams) cane sugar",
            "Pinch freshly ground nutmeg",
            "1/2 teaspoon salt",
            "2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted",
            "1/3 cup milk",
            "1 teaspoon vanilla extract",
            "1 egg",
            "Semisweet chocolate, tempered or melted, or powdered sugar, for coating"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Preheat the oven to 400\u00b0F and lightly grease a mini doughnut pan.",
            "Sift the white spelt, rye, barley, and baking powder together. Whisk in the sugar, nutmeg, and salt. Set aside.",
            "In a separate bowl, whisk together the melted butter, milk, vanilla, and egg. Add the egg mixture to the flour mixture and stir until just combined. Do not overmix or your doughnuts may be rubbery.",
            "Fill each doughnut cup 1/2 to 3/4 of the way full with the batter. You can do this with a spoon, but I prefer using a piping bag to fill each cup evenly and cleanly. It's important not to overfill or as the doughnuts rise, you'll lose the hole. Bake until the doughnuts spring back when touched, 6 to 10 minutes depending on the size of your doughnut pan. Let cool completely on a wire rack; then dip in melted chocolate or dust with powdered sugar."
