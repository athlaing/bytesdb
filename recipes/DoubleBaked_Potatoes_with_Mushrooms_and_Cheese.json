        "instructions": [
            "Preheat oven to 375\u00b0F. Pierce each potato in several places with fork. Place all potatoes directly on oven rack and bake until tender, about 1 hour.",
            "Meanwhile, melt 1 tablespoon butter in heavy large skillet over medium heat. Add mushrooms; saut\u00e9 until beginning to brown, stirring frequently, about 7 minutes. Add green onions; stir until wilted, about 1 minute. Set aside.",
            "Using oven mitts as aid, cut each potato lengthwise in half. Scoop cooked potato flesh into large bowl, leaving skin intact. Add cream cheese, sour cream, and remaining 4 tablespoons butter and mash well. Mix in mushroom mixture and 1/2 cup cheddar cheese. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Mound mashed potatoes in potato skins. Sprinkle each half with 1 tablespoon cheese. Place on baking sheet. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Cover and refrigerate.)",
            "Preheat oven to 375\u00b0F. Bake potatoes until heated through and cheese melts, about 25 minutes, or 35 minutes if potatoes have been refrigerated."
