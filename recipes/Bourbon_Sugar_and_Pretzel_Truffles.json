        "ingredients": [
            "3/4 cup (180ml) single (pouring) cream (in the US, use light cream)",
            "600g dark chocolate, finely chopped",
            "2 cups (100g) store-bought pretzels, crushed",
            "1/2 teaspoon sea salt flakes",
            "1/3 cup (80ml) bourbon",
            "1 cup (220g) Demerara sugar",
            "2 tablespoons bourbon"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Place the cream in a small saucepan over high heat and bring to the boil. Place the chocolate in a medium heatproof bowl and top with the cream. Place the bowl over a saucepan of simmering water (the bowl shouldn\u2019t touch the water) and, using a metal spoon, stir until melted and smooth. Add the crushed pretzels, salt and bourbon and mix well to combine. Allow to stand at room temperature for 10 minutes. Refrigerate for 2\u20133 hours or until just set. While the mixture is cooling, make the bourbon sugar. Preheat oven to 160\u00b0C (325\u00b0F). Line a large baking tray with non-stick baking paper. Place the sugar and bourbon in a small bowl and mix to combine. Spread in an even layer on the tray and bake for 30 minutes or until golden and crisp. Allow to cool completely before crushing into fine crumbs. Roll 1-teaspoon portions of the truffle mixture into balls and press in the bourbon sugar to coat. Place the truffles on the tray and refrigerate for 30 minutes or until firm.",
