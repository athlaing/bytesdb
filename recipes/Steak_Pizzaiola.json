            "2 1/2-inch-thick boneless rib eyes, room temperature",
            "2 tablespoons olive oil, plus more for serving",
            "2 garlic cloves, thinly sliced",

            "Season steaks generously with salt and pepper. Heat 2 Tbsp. oil in a large skillet over medium-high. Cook steaks, undisturbed, until deeply browned underneath, about 3 minutes. Turn and drain all but 1 Tbsp. fat from skillet (if needed). Place garlic next to steaks and cook, stirring occasionally, until beginning to brown around edges, about 30 seconds. Add basil and red pepper flakes, then marinara. Bring mixture to a simmer and spoon sauce over steaks to smother. Cook steaks until just cooked through but still pink in the center, about 3 minutes. Transfer steaks and sauce to a platter. Sprinkle with oregano and drizzle with oil.",
