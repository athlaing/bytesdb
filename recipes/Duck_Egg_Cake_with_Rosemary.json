        "ingredients": [
            "Unsalted butter or duck fat, for greasing",
            "4 duck eggs",
            "3/4 cup sugar",
            "3 tablespoons olive oil",
            "7 tablespoons duck fat, melted",
            "2 tablespoons minced fresh rosemary",
            "1 1/2 cups cake flour",
            "1 tablespoon baking powder",
            "Healthy pinch of kosher salt"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Preheat the oven to 325\u00b0F. Grease a 9-inch loaf pan with butter. Crack the duck eggs into a large bowl, add the sugar, and beat with a whisk until well combined and slightly frothy. Drizzle in the oil and duck fat while stirring the mixture. Once the fat is well incorporated into the mixture, sprinkle the rosemary on top. In a second bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, and salt. Using the whisk, stir the flour into the egg-fat mixture until combined. Pour the batter into the prepared pan and bake for 50 minutes. Stick a toothpick into the center of the cake, and if it comes out clean, the cake is ready. If not, bake for another 10 minutes. Let the cake cool in the pan on a cooling rack for 5 minutes, then turn it out onto the rack. Slice and eat warm or at room temperature.",
