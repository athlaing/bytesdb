        "ingredients": [
            "2 large egg yolks",
            "1 sheet frozen puff pastry (one 14 ounce package or half a 17.3 ounce package), thawed",
            "All-purpose flour (for dusting)",
            "4 precooked pork sausages (such as andouille or kielbasa; about 1 pound), halved lengthwise",
            "1/2 teaspoons baking soda",
            "Kosher salt and poppy seeds (for sprinkling)",
            "Whole grain Dijon mustard (for serving)"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Preheat oven to 400\u00b0. Mix yolks and 1 tablespoon water in a small bowl until smooth. Gently roll out puff pastry on a lightly floured surface just to press out any creases; brush with egg wash. Cut into 8 long strips. Lightly dust sausages with flour. Working one at a time, wrap pastry around sausage, egg wash side facing in. If pastry becomes too soft, chill until firm before continuing.",
            "Place rolled-up sausages on a parchment-lined baking sheet, cut side down. Mix baking soda into remaining egg wash and brush over pastry (this will give dough a sheen); sprinkle with salt and poppy seeds. Chill 15 minutes.",
            "Bake until pastry is puffed and golden brown, 25\u201330 minutes. Let cool. Slice into bite-size portions and serve with mustard.",
            "Do ahead: Sausages can be rolled in pastry 1 day ahead. Cover and chill. Brush with egg wash and sprinkle with salt and poppy seeds just before baking."
