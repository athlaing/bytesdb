        "instructions": [
            "Make flatbread: In bowl of stand mixer fitted with paddle attachment, stir together water, yeast, and sugar until dissolved, about 5 seconds. Let stand until foamy, about 5 minutes. In large bowl, whisk together flour and salt. Add to yeast mixture and mix on low speed until just combined, about 30 seconds. Add oil and mix on low speed until just combined, about 30 seconds. Switch to dough hook and mix on medium speed until dough is elastic and pulls away from sides, about 8 minutes. (Dough should feel firm and moist, but not sticky.) Lightly oil large bowl. Gently shape dough into ball and transfer to bowl. Turn over several times to coat lightly with oil, then cover with plastic wrap and let rise in warm place (80\u00b0F to 85\u00b0F, see Chef's Notes) until doubled in size, about 1 hour. While dough is rising, position rack near bottom of oven and top with pizza stone or heavy baking sheet. Preheat oven to 450\u00b0F for 1 hour. Set smooth rollers of pasta machine on widest setting (see Chef's Notes). Divide dough into 6 equal parts. Cover 5 parts with plastic wrap. Shape remaining piece into rough rectangle and feed through rollers once to flatten into roughly 12-by 4-inch rectangle, approximately 1/8-inch thick. Transfer flatbread to large baking sheet, dust with flour, and top with sheet of parchment paper. Roll out remaining flatbreads in same manner, stacking between layers of parchment paper. Cover with plastic wrap until ready to bake. Transfer 1 or more flatbreads to preheated pizza stone and bake in batches until slightly puffed but still pale, about 5 minutes. Transfer to wire rack to cool completely. Leave oven on. DO AHEAD: Flatbreads can be prepared ahead and frozen, wrapped tightly in parchment paper and plastic wrap, up to 6 months.",
