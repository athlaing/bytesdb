            "2 tablespoons water",
            "1 large egg",
            "1 tablespoon unsalted butter, melted and cooled, plus additional for brushing the pan and cr\u00eapes",

            "In a blender or small food processor blend flour, milk, water, egg, 1 tablespoon of butter, and a pinch salt 5 seconds. Turn off motor and scrape down sides of container. Blend batter 20 seconds more. Transfer batter to a bowl and let stand, covered, 15 minutes. Heat a 6- to 7-inch cr\u00eape pan (preferably cast iron) over moderate heat until hot. Brush pan lightly with additional butter and heat until hot but not smoking. Remove pan from heat. Stir batter and half fill a 1/4-cup measure with it. Pour batter into pan, tilting and rotating pan quickly to cover bottom with a thin layer of batter, and return any excess to bowl. Return pan to heat and loosen edge of cr\u00eape with a spatula. Cook cr\u00eape until underside is browned lightly. Turn cr\u00eape and brown other side lightly. Transfer cr\u00eape to a plate. Make more cr\u00eapes with remaining batter in same manner, brushing pan lightly with additional butter as necessary. Preheat broiler. Divide cream cheese and jelly among cr\u00eapes. Fold each cr\u00eape into quarters and arrange, overlapping slightly, in a buttered shallow flameproof dish. Brush cr\u00eapes lightly with additional butter and sprinkle with sugar. Broil cr\u00eapes under broiler about 4 inches from heat 1 minute, or until bubbling and golden.",
