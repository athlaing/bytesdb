            "3/4 cup vegetable oil",
            "1/4 cup dark molasses",
            "1 1/4 cups sugar",
            "2 large eggs",
            "2 3/4 cups all-purpose flour",
            "1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda",
            "1 1/2 tablespoons cinnamon",
            "1 1/2 tablespoons ground ginger",

        "instructions": [
            "In a large bowl with an electric mixer beat together the oil, the molasses, 1 cup of the sugar, and the eggs until the mixture is smooth. In a bowl stir together the flour, the baking soda, the cinnamon, the ginger, the cloves, and the mace and add the mixture to the molasses mixture. Beat the mixture until it is combined well and chill the dough, covered, overnight. Form the dough into 1 1/2-inch balls and roll the balls in the remaining 1/4 cup sugar to coat them well. Bake the balls 3 inches apart on buttered baking sheets in the middle of a preheated 350\u00b0F. oven for 10 to 12 minutes, or until the tops crack. Transfer the cookies to racks and let them cool."
