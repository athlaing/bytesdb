            "Melt the butter with the crushed garlic, ever so gently, in a small saucepan. Remove from the heat and set aside to infuse. Heat the oil in a large pot. Add the popcorn, tossing to coat. Cover, and shake the pan over high heat until all the corn has popped. Remove from the heat. Pluck the garlic cloves from the butter and pour over the popcorn. Toss. Add the herbes de Provence and plenty of celery salt. Toss again. Season with regular salt to taste, and serve."
