            "Prepare a grill for medium-high, indirect heat (for a gas grill, leave one or two burners off; for a charcoal grill, bank coals on one side of grill); oil grate. Mix almonds, lemon juice, capers, honey, and 4 Tbsp. oil in a small bowl; season dressing with salt and pepper.",
            "Combine broccolini and kale in a large bowl and drizzle with remaining 1 Tbsp. oil. Toss well to evenly coat vegetables; season with salt.",

            "Meanwhile, cook broccolini and kale over direct heat until kale is lightly browned and crisp around the edges and broccolini stem is crisp-tender, about 1 minute for kale and 3 minutes for broccolini. Transfer back to bowl.",

            "Mound some of the salad on top of the sausage and leave some in the bowl. Drizzle remaining dressing over all of the salad and top with remaining Pecorino."
