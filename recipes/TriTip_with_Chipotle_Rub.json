        "ingredients": [
            "2 - 2 1/2 pound tri-tip steak (about 2\" thick)",
            "Kosher salt",
            "Chipotle Rub"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Sprinkle tri-tip with kosher salt. Massage Chipotle Rub into meat. Let steak sit at room temperature for 1 hour or refrigerate uncovered overnight. Bring to room temperature before grilling. Build a two-zone fire in a charcoal grill, or preheat a gas grill to medium-high. Cook 3-4 minutes per side over direct heat until nicely charred. Transfer to low-heat side (or lower gas grill heat to medium) and cook an additional 6-8 minutes per side or until an instant-read thermometer registers 120\u00b0F for rare (steak will carry over to 125\u00b0F, or medium-rare, as it rests). Transfer meat to a carving board; let rest for 10 minutes. Thinly slice against the grain.",
