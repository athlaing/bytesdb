            "Mix all ingredients except salt in a small bowl until lime juice is incorporated. Season with salt. Cover; keep in a cool place. DO AHEAD: Spiced butter can be made 1 week ahead. Roll into logs, wrap in parchment paper, and refrigerate for up to 2 weeks or freeze for up to 3 months.",
            "For squash: Trim ends of acorn and kabocha squash and cut in half through the stem end. Scrape out seeds and place squash cut side down on a cutting board (do not peel). Cut halves crosswise into 1/2\" slices. If using delicata squash, cut crosswise into 1/2\" rings; scrape out seeds. Fill a large wide pot with water to a depth of 1/2\" and add a pinch of salt; bring to a boil. Add squash slices; reduce heat to mediumlow. Cover and steam, adding more water as needed to maintain 1/2\" of water at bottom of pot, until squash is tender but not falling apart, 20-25 minutes. Carefully transfer squash slices to a large platter (some squash at bottom of pot may be too soft; save for another purpose4) and season with salt. Reduce water in pot over high heat (or add hot water) to measure 3/4 cup. Remove from heat and whisk in spiced butter, 1 tablespoonful at a time, to form a rich, glossy sauce. Season to taste with salt. Drizzle spiced butter over squash. Top with pomegranate seeds.",
