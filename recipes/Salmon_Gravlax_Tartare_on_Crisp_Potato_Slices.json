        "ingredients": [
            "1 tablespoon juniper berries, chopped",
            "2 teaspoons dried dill",
            "3 tablespoons sugar",
            "4 tablespoons kosher salt (if you only have table salt, 3 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon would be the correct equivalent)",
            "5 ounces center-cut fresh salmon, skinned, pin-boned, and cut into tiny dice",
            "2 tablespoons Gravlax Cure",
            "1 teaspoon extra-virgin olive oil",
            "1 tablespoon snipped chives",
            "1/8 teaspoon grated orange zest",
            "1/8 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper",
            "1 bunch dill, minced, for decoration",
            "10 small round potatoes (red or white), cut into 1/8-inch circular slices (discarding rounded ends)",
            "1/2 cup olive oil",
            "1 teaspoon kosher salt",
            "1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper"

        "instructions": [
            "Mix all the ingredients together in a small bowl. You can make the cure in advance and it will keep, stored in an airtight jar out of the sunlight, for up to 6 months.",
            "For the Tartare: In a medium bowl, mix the salmon with 2 tablespoons of the Gravlax Cure and then add the olive oil, snipped chives, orange zest, and pepper. Cover and refrigerate overnight, or for at least 6 hours. Serve topped with a scattering of freshly minced dill on a Crisp Potato Slice or an English cucumber slice. Strew some more minced dill on the plate or tray that you're using to pass the hors d'oeuvres \u2014 then the Crisp Potato Slices won't skid around and the cucumber will be easier to pick up.",

            "For The Crisp Potato Slices: Position a rack in the top third of the oven and preheat to 350\u00b0F. Arrange the potatoes in a single layer on a baking sheet; brush each slice with oil, then turn them and brush the other side. Sprinkle with salt and pepper and bake for 10 minutes, then turn slices and bake for another 5 minutes. Remove all crisp slices with a spatula and continue cooking any slices that look like they need more time. Cool on a rack, then use immediately or store in an airtight container for up to 2 days.",
