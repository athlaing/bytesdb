            "Using box grater or food processor fitted with grating disc, coarsely grate potatoes. Transfer to colander, rinse with cold water, and allow to drain. Add onions and press mixture with paper towels to squeeze out remaining liquid. Transfer mixture to large bowl, add eggs, scallions, parsley, flour, salt, and pepper and stir gently to combine. In large nonstick skillet over moderate heat, heat 3 tablespoons oil until hot but not smoking. Drop 4 (1/3 cup) portions batter into pan and gently flatten each into 3-inch-diameter (3/4-inch-thick) disk. Fry, turning once, until well browned on both sides, about 8 minutes total. Transfer to paper towels to drain and keep warm in oven. Fry remaining pancakes in 2 batches, wiping pan clean and adding 3 tablespoons oil between each batch. Serve immediately.",
