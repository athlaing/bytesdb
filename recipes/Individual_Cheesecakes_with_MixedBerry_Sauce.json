        "instructions": [
            "Preheat oven to 325\u00b0F. Butter six 1 1/4 cup custard cups. Toss ground cookies with melted butter in medium bowl to blend. Press 3 tablespoons cookie mixture evenly onto bottom of each prepared cup; reserve remaining cookie mixture.",
            "Using electric mixer, beat cream cheese, sugar, and vanilla in large bowl until fluffy, occasionally scraping down sides of bowl, about 1 minute. Add eggs and yolks 1 at a time, blending well after each addition. Divide batter equally among custard cups. Sprinkle reserved cookie mixture evenly atop batter. Place cups in large roasting pan. Add enough hot water to pan to reach halfway up sides of cups. Bake until cheesecakes are set in center, about 45 minutes. Remove cheesecakes from water bath. Cool completely. Wrap in plastic and refrigerate until cold, about 2 hours. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Keep refrigerated.)",
            "For sauce: Melt butter in heavy medium skillet over high heat. Mix in sugar. Add berries and stir until sugar dissolves and berries are heated through, about 3 minutes. Remove skillet from heat; stir in liqueur. Cut around cheesecakes to loosen. Turn cheesecakes out onto plates. Pour warm berry sauce around cheesecakes.",
