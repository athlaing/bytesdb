        "instructions": [
            "Preheat oven to 350\u00b0F. Using your hands, coarsely crumble crackers onto a parchment-lined baking sheet. Toast in oven until golden brown, 8\u201310 minutes. Transfer baking sheet to a wire rack and let crackers cool.",
            "Meanwhile, heat sugar, honey, and butter in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, until butter is melted. Fit saucepan with thermometer and cook, whisking frequently, until thermometer registers 300\u00b0F, 8\u201310 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in baking soda (mixture will bubble vigorously). Quickly pour mixture over crackers, spreading to coat evenly. Let cool completely.",
            "Drizzle chocolate over cooled crackers; immediately top with cherries, coffee beans, hazelnuts, and cacao nibs and sprinkle with salt. Chill until chocolate is hardened, at least 10 minutes. Break bark into pieces.",
            "MAKE AHEAD: Bark can be made 3 days ahead. Wrap tightly and keep chilled."
