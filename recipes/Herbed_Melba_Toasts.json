            "1 tablespoon unsalted butter, melted",

            "In a small bowl stir together the butter, the dill, the thyme, and salt and pepper to taste. Roll each slice of bread as thin as possible with a rolling pin and trim and discard the crusts. Brush both sides of the bread with the butter mixture, cut each slice diagonally into 2 triangles, and bake the triangles on a baking sheet in the middle of a preheated 350\u00b0F. oven, turning them once, for 15 minutes, or until they are browned lightly and crisp. Let the toasts cool on the rack."
