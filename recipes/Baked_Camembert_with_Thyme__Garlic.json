        "ingredients": [
            "1 x 9oz camembert in its wooden box",
            "1 garlic clove, peeled and sliced into matchsticks",
            "1/2 teaspoon fresh thyme leaves",
            "1 tablespoon maple syrup",
            "1 small baguette, cut into 1/2 in slices",
            "2 tablespoons olive oil, plus extra for brushing",
            "crushed sea salt"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Preheat the oven to 400\u00b0F. Remove the camembert from the box and discard any wax paper packaging. Take a 10-inch square of foil and place in the box. Place the camembert inside.",
            "Pierce the top of the camembert with the tip of a knife and push in the slices of garlic. Sprinkle the thyme leaves over the top and drizzle with the maple syrup. Loosely scrunch the foil up over the cheese. Set aside.",
            "Brush two 12-inch square sheets (the size of your baking sheet) of parchment paper with oil. Line a baking sheet with one of the oiled parchment sheets, oil-side up. Spread the slices of baguette over the sheet. Drizzle with olive oil and sprinkle with crushed sea salt. Place the remaining sheet of parchment, oil-side down, over the bread.",
            "Place in the oven with the camembert and cook both for 10 to 12 minutes until the cheese has risen and the bread is crisp. Open up the foil and dip in the hot baguette for a simple snack. Delicious!"
