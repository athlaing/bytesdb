Beat in dry ingredients in 3 additions, alternating with buttermilk mixture in 2 additions. Beat egg whites in another large bowl until stiff but not dry. Fold into batter.

Maintain oven temperature. Spread flaked coconut on large baking sheet. Bake until lightly toasted, stirring once, about 14 minutes. Cool. (Cakes and coconut can be made 1 day ahead. Cover separately with plastic wrap and let stand at room temperature.)",
