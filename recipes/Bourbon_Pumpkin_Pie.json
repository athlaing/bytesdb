            "1 cup heavy cream",
            "1/3 cup sour cream",
            "2 large eggs",
            "3/4 cup sugar",
            "3 1/2 tablespoons bourbon",
            "1 teaspoon ground cinnamon",
            "3/4 teaspoon ground ginger",
            "1/4 teaspoon ground allspice",
            "1/4 teaspoon salt",
            "Accompaniment: lightly sweetened whipped cream (add 1 teaspoon bourbon per 1/2 cup cream if desired)",

        "instructions": [
            "Roll out dough on a lightly floured surface with a lightly floured rolling pin into a 12-inch round and fit into pie plate. Trim edge, leaving a 1/2-inch overhang. Fold overhang under and lightly press against rim of pie plate, then crimp decoratively. Lightly prick bottom all over with a fork. Chill until firm, at least 30 minutes (or freeze 10 minutes). Preheat oven to 375\u00b0F with rack in middle. Line shell with foil and fill with pie weights. Bake until side is set and edge is golden, about 20 minutes. Carefully remove weights and foil and bake shell until golden all over, 10 to 15 minutes more. Cool completely. Whisk together remaining ingredients and pour into cooled shell. Bake until edge of filling is set but center trembles slightly, about 45 minutes (filling will continue to set as it cools). Cool completely.",
