        "title": "Asparagus Guacamole and Chips ",
        "ingredients": [
            "1 medium Anaheim chile (or for extra heat, 1 serrano chile)",
            "1 tsp olive oil",
            "5 or 6 fresh asparagus spears, ends trimmed",
            "1/2 cup nonfat plain yogurt",
            "2 medium avocados, cut into cubes (about 2 cups)",
            "1 plum tomato, seeded and diced",
            "1 tbsp chopped green onion",
            "1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro",
            "1 tbsp fresh lime juice (or more to taste)",
            "Dash garlic powder",
            "1/2 tsp salt",
            "1/2 tsp freshly ground black pepper",
            "Baked tortilla chips"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Preheat broiler. Wearing rubber gloves to protect your skin, rub chile with oil; broil 5 minutes, turning with tongs so all sides get charred. Transfer to a plastic bag, seal and set aside to steam 10 minutes. Remove stem, skin and seeds from chile and dice. Set aside. (Remove gloves only when you are finished handling the chile.) Fill medium saut\u00e9 pan halfway with water and bring to a boil. Prepare a medium-sized bowl of ice water. Place asparagus spears into boiling water 3 to 4 minutes or until just tender. Remove and plunge spears into ice water to halt cooking and preserve color. When cool, remove, dry thoroughly and chop into 1-inch pieces. Transfer to blender or food processor, add yogurt and avocado and process until smooth. Transfer to a mixing bowl and stir in remaining ingredients (except chips). Serve with baked tortilla chips."
