            "3/4 teaspoon salt",
            "4 large eggs",

            "Stir batter well. Heat a non-stick skillet measuring 8 inches across bottom over moderate heat until hot. Brush skillet lightly with melted butter. Remove skillet from heat. Fill a 1/4-cup measure three fourths full with batter and pour into skillet, tilting and rotating skillet quickly to cover bottom.",
            "Return skillet to heat and cook cr\u00eape until underside is golden, 15 to 30 seconds. Slide cr\u00eape onto a kitchen towel to cool. Make more cr\u00eapes in same manner with remaining batter, brushing skillet lightly with butter for each and stacking cooked cr\u00eapes on another kitchen towel as they cool. Cr\u00eapes may be made 3 days ahead and chilled, stacked and wrapped well in plastic wrap."
