            "2- 1 1/2\"-thick bone-in pork rib chops (8\u201310 ounces each)",
            "Kosher salt, freshly ground pepper",
            "freshly ground pepper",
            "8 sprigs sage",

        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Heat oil in a large skillet over mediumhigh. Season pork chops all over (including the fat cap) with salt and pepper. Cook pork chops until bottom side is golden brown, about 1 minute. Turn and cook on other side about 1 minute before turning again. Repeat this process, turning about every minute, until chops are deep golden brown and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part registers 135\u00b0, 8\u201310 minutes (cooking time will depend on thickness of chops).",
            "Remove pan from heat and add sage, garlic, and butter, smashing garlic into butter. Tilt skillet and spoon foaming butter and drippings over pork chops, making sure to baste the fat cap as well as the rib. Transfer pork chops to a cutting board and let rest at least 5 minutes (pork will come to 145\u00b0 as it sits).",
            "Cut away bone and slice pork about 1/4\" thick. Serve with any juices from the cutting board spooned over top."
