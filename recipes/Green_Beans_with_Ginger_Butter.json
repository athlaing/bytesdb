        "ingredients": [
            "2 pounds haricots verts or other green beans, trimmed",
            "1 (3-inch-long) piece fresh ginger",
            "3 tablespoons unsalted butter",
            "Finely grated zest from 1/2 lemon",

        "instructions": [
            "Cook beans in an 8-quart pot of boiling salted water, uncovered, until just tender, 5 to 9 minutes (depending on thickness). Drain beans in a colander and transfer to a large bowl of ice and cold water to stop cooking. Drain beans again and pat dry. Peel ginger and halve crosswise, then thinly slice lengthwise and cut into very thin matchsticks. Heat butter in a 12-inch nonstick skillet over moderate heat until foam subsides, then cook ginger, stirring, until golden, about 3 minutes. Add beans and cook, stirring, until just heated through, about 2 minutes. Remove from heat and add zest and salt, tossing to combine.",
