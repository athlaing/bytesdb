        "ingredients": [
            "1 1/2 lb. flat-cut beef brisket, fat trimmed to 1/4\" thick",
            "4 garlic cloves, finely grated",
            "1/4 cup fresh lime juice",
            "1/4 cup oyster sauce",
            "2 Tbsp. soy sauce",
            "2 Tbsp. dark brown sugar",
            "2 tsp. toasted sesame oil",
            "Vegetable oil (for grill)",
            "1/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil",
            "1/3 cup chopped raw peanuts",
            "1 garlic clove, finely grated",
            "2 tsp. toasted sesame seeds",
            "1 tsp. crushed red pepper flakes",
            "2 Tbsp. fresh lime juice",
            "2 tsp. honey",
            "Kosher salt",
            "1 bunch scallions (about 6), thinly sliced into matchsticks",
            "1/2 bunch cilantro, torn into sprigs"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Freeze brisket on a small baking sheet until very firm around the edges, 45\u201360 minutes.",
            "Remove brisket from freezer. Using a long sharp knife, slice brisket against the grain 1/8\" thick. (As the piece gets smaller, you can cut it in half crosswise to make it easier to cut.) Place inside a resealable plastic bag. Whisk garlic, lime juice, oyster sauce, soy sauce, brown sugar, and oil in a small bowl until sugar dissolves. Pour marinade over meat, seal bag, and rub vigorously to separate any meat slices that might want to stick together so the marinade can get to them. Chill at least 1 hour and up to 1 day.",
            "Salsa and assembly: Prepare a grill for medium heat; oil grate. Cook olive oil and peanuts in a small saucepan over medium heat, swirling occasionally, until peanuts are very faintly sizzling and turn golden, 6\u20138 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in garlic, sesame seeds, and red pepper flakes. Let cool. Stir in lime juice and honey. Season salsa with salt; set aside. Rinse scallions under cold water; drain well. Toss in a medium bowl with cilantro. Transfer brisket slices to a large rimmed baking sheet with tongs, leaving any excess marinade behind. Lightly season with salt. Grill meat in batches until charred underneath and nearly cooked through, 1\u20132 minutes, then turn and grill just long enough to cook through, about 30 seconds. Transfer to a platter. Toss scallion mixture into peanut mixture and mound over brisket.",
