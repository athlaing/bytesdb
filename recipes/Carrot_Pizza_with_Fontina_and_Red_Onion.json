        "instructions": [
            "For the carrot pur\u00e9e: Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high until shimmering. Add onions and cook, stirring often, until translucent, about 2 minutes. Add carrots and cook, stirring occasionally, until beginning to brown, about 5 minutes, then add wine and cook, stirring often, until reduced by half, about 2 minutes. Reduce heat to medium-low, add salt and 1 cup water, and stir to combine. Cover and simmer until carrots are tender and most of the liquid has evaporated, about 15 minutes. Transfer mixture to a blender. Add mascarpone, cayenne, and 1/4 cup water. Remove stopper from lid or leave lid slightly ajar, cover with a towel (hot liquids can splatter), and pur\u00e9e until smooth.",

            "For the pizza: Place 2 overturned rimmed baking sheets in the upper and lower thirds of oven and preheat to 450\u00b0F. Divide dough in half on a lightly floured surface and form into 2 balls. Roll out balls into ovals about 6x10 inches in size (make sure they fit on baking sheets). Remove preheated sheets from oven and brush bottoms with oil. Carefully place dough on sheets and brush with more oil. Return to oven and bake until dough is beginning to brown, about 5 minutes. Spread reserved carrot pur\u00e9e evenly on pizzas, then sprinkle with cheese and onion. Return to oven and bake pizzas, rotating the sheets and swapping their positions on the oven racks halfway through, until cheese is melted and bubbling, 10\u201312 minutes. Transfer pizzas to cutting boards, top with carrot fronds, and slice.",
