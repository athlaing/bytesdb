            "Green juice: Blend romaine, cucumber, kale, cilantro, and 1/4 cup water in a blender until fairly smooth, about 1 minute. Strain through a fine-mesh sieve into a small bowl or measuring glass, pressing on solids to release as much liquid as possible; you should have about 1/2 cup. (Alternatively, you can do this step in a juicer.) Stir in lime juice and season with salt. Taste and adjust flavor with more lime juice, if needed.",

            "Tomatoes and assembly: Preheat oven to 400\u00b0F. Toss bread with 2 tablespoons oil on a rimmed baking sheet; season with kosher salt. Bake, tossing halfway through, until golden brown and crisp, 6\u20138 minutes. Let bread cool, then gently crush with a flat-bottomed measuring cup into smaller pieces. Prepare a grill for medium-high heat or heat a grill pan over medium-high. Brush tomatoes on both sides with 1 tablespoon oil and grill until softened and lightly charred, about 4 minutes per side. Transfer to plates and drizzle with vinegar, 1/3 cup green juice, and 1 tablespoon oil. Season with kosher salt and pepper and top with burrata. Toss scallions, jalapeno, almonds, breadcrumbs, 2 tablespoons green juice, and remaining 3 tablespoons oil in a medium bowl; season with kosher salt and pepper. Add cilantro and toss again to bring everything together. Scatter scallion mixture evenly over tomatoes and burrata; drizzle with oil and sprinkle with sea salt.",
