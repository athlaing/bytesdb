        "ingredients": [
            "1 tablespoon unsalted butter, at room temperature",
            "2 slices sandwich bread",
            "2 ounces Gruy\u00e8re cheese, sliced",
            "3 ounces Black Forest ham, sliced",
            "1 tablespoon Maple Butter",
            "Belgian or standard waffle maker"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Preheat the waffle iron on low.",
            "Spread a thin, even layer of butter on one side of each piece of bread.",
            "Pile the cheese and ham on the unbuttered side of one slice of bread, and put the open-face sandwich in the waffle iron as far away from the hinge as possible. (This allows the lid to press down on the sandwich more evenly.) Place the second slice of bread on top, with the buttered side up, and close the waffle iron.",
            "Check the sandwich after 3 minutes. About halfway through, you may need to rotate the sandwich 180 degrees to ensure even pressure and cooking. If you\u2019d like, you can press down on the lid of the waffle iron a bit to compact the sandwich, but do so carefully\u2014the lid could be very hot. Remove the sandwich from the waffle iron when the bread is golden brown and the cheese is melted.",
            "Spread the Maple Butter on the outside of the sandwich. Slice in half diagonally and serve."
