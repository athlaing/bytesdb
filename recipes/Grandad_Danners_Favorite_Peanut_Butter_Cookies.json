            "1 1/4 cups unbleached all-purpose flour",
            "1/2 teaspoon baking soda",
            "1/2 teaspoon baking powder",
            "1/2 teaspoon fine salt",
            "8 tablespoons (1 stick) unsalted butter, at room temperature",
            "3/4 cup smooth peanut butter, at room temperature",
            "1/2 cup firmly packed dark brown sugar",
            "1/2 cup firmly packed light brown sugar",
            "1 organic large egg, at room temperature",
            "1 teaspoon vanilla extract",
            "1 cup peanut butter chips",

        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Preheat oven to 350\u00b0F. Whisk together the dry ingredients in a medium bowl. In a large bowl, cream together the butter, peanut butter, and brown sugars. Stir in the egg and vanilla. Add the flour in thirds and stir until smooth. Fold in the peanut butter chips. Roll the mixture into golf ball-sized balls (about 1 1/2 tablespoons). At this point you can roll them in granulated sugar or you can press each cookie down with the tines of a fork. Either way, bake for 10 minutes, in a nonstick baking pan, rotating the pan halfway through baking time. Cool the cookies on a rack before serving.",
