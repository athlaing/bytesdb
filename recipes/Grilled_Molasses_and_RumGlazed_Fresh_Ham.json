            "1 (8- to 10-lb) bone-in shank-end fresh ham, skinned and trimmed of all but a thin layer of fat",
            "2 tablespoons plus 2 teaspoons coriander seeds",

        "instructions": [
            "Bring all brining ingredients except ham to a boil in a deep 8- to 9-quart pot (such as a pasta pot), stirring occasionally until sugar and salt are dissolved. Remove from heat and add ham. (Brine should cover ham; if not, make more brine.) Cool mixture 30 minutes, then chill, covered, turning ham once or twice, at least 1 day and up to 2.",
            "Prepare grill for cooking using enough hardwood charcoal to fill a charcoal chimney or a shoe box. When coals are ready, push them to one side of grill, leaving about two thirds of grill without coals. Put a drip pan opposite coals.",
            "Make spice rub and cook ham: Finely grind all spice-rub ingredients together in an electric coffee/spice grinder. Drain ham and pat dry. Rub ground spices all over ham. Place ham on grill rack, fatty side up, over drip pan. Cover grill, leaving cover vents one fourth open and bottom vents fully open, and cook ham, adding a large handful of charcoal every 30 minutes. After 1 hour, turn ham around so other side faces coals and continue to cook until a meat thermometer inserted near but not touching bone registers 155\u00b0F, 1 to 2 hours more.",
