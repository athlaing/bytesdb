        "ingredients": [
            "1 pound precut fresh carrot sticks",
            "5 1/2 tablespoons olive oil, divided",
            "1 (1 1/4-pound) pork tenderloin",
            "2 tablespoons Dijon mustard, divided",
            "1/4 cup fine dry bread crumbs",
            "2 garlic cloves, smashed",

        "instructions": [
            "Preheat oven to 425\u00b0F with rack in middle.",
            "Toss carrots with 2 tablespoons oil and 1/4 teaspoon each of salt and pepper in a shallow baking pan and roast while preparing pork.",
            "Pat pork dry and sprinkle with 1/2 teaspoon salt. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a 12-inch heavy skillet over medium-high heat until it shimmers, then brown pork all over, about 3 minutes total.",
            "Put pork on a work surface and brush with 1 tablespoon mustard. Stir together bread crumbs and 1/2 tablespoon oil, then press onto mustard on pork to form a crust.",
            "Transfer pork to pan with carrots and roast until carrots are browned and tender and an instant-read thermometer inserted into center of meat registers 140 to 145\u00b0F, 15 to 22 minutes. Let pork stand 5 minutes; keep carrots warm, covered (or continue roasting if needed).",
            "While pork roasts, heat remaining 2 tablespoons oil with garlic and thyme in a small saucepan until fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir in lentils, broth, and remaining tablespoon mustard and cook until heated through. Season with salt and pepper and discard thyme. Serve pork with carrots and lentils."
