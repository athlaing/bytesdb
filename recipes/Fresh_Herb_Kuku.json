            "Najmieh Batmanglij shares her tips with Epicurious: \u2022Though many Iranians now use vegetable oil, clarified butter (ghee) is Iran's traditional cooking fat. To make it, start with a third more unsalted butter than you will need for the recipe. Melt the butter over low heat, then increase the heat to medium low and simmer the butter, without stirring, until it stops crackling and the milk solids brown and drop to the bottom. Skim off any foam from the top, and strain the ghee through a colander lined with cheesecloth. Ghee will keep at room temperature, covered, for several months. \u2022Advieh, a mix of ground cinnamon, cardamom, and cumin and dried rose petals, is available online at www.sadaf.com. \u2022Dried barberries, which add a sour flavor to many Persian dishes, are available online at www.sadaf.com. \"I like to use the dried fenugreek leaves in the batter, and also some red barberries on top for color,\" says Batmanglij. \"Saut\u00e9 them with a little oil and a teaspoon of sugar, then sprinkle them on top of the kuku just before serving.\"",
