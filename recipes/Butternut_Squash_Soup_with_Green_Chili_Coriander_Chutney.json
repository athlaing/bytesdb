Add the coriander and blend the mixture until it is ground fine. (This recipe makes what is known as a dry chutney, which has a slightly grainy texture.)

Add the broth, the zest, and the juice and simmer the mixture, uncovered, for 15 minutes. In a blender or food processor pur\u00e9e the mixture in batches and strain it through a sieve into a large bowl. The soup may be made 1 day in advance and kept covered and chilled.",
