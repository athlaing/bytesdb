        "ingredients": [
            "8 ounces thin spaghetti",
            "2 pints cherry tomatoes (such as orange, red, and yellow teardrop varieties)",
            "2 garlic cloves, peeled and finely chopped",
            "4 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil",
            "1 cup fresh arugula (optional)",
            "Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "1. Cook the pasta until al dente. 2. Meanwhile, in a large bowl, squeeze the tomatoes to break them up (it's faster than chopping, and your kid will likely love joining in). 3. Add the garlic, oil, arugula (if using), salt, and pepper; set aside. 4. Drain the pasta (reserving 1/2 cup of the water) and toss it with the tomatoes. If the pasta is still a little dry, add some of the cooking water. 5. Let sit until the heat from the pasta has cooked the tomatoes and garlic slightly and wilted the arugula, 1 to 2 minutes. Serve warm or at room temperature.",
