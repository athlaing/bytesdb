            "In a large bowl soak beans in cold water to cover by 2 inches at least 6 hours and up to 1 day. Drain beans. In a 3 x 4-quart saucepan cover beans with cold water by 2 inches and simmer until tender, 1 to 1 1/4 hours. After about 45 minutes, season beans with salt. Drain beans in a colander and transfer to a bowl. Gently stir vinaigrette into warm beans. Beans may be prepared up to this point 1 day ahead and cooled, uncovered, before being chilled, covered.",
