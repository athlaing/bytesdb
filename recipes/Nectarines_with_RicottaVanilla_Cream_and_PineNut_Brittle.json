            "3 nectarines (about 1 pound), cut into wedges",
            "1/2 cup plus 4 teaspoon sugar, divided",
            "1 teaspoon fresh lime juice",
            "1/2 pound ricotta (1 cup)",
            "1/4 cup whole milk",
            "3/4 teaspoon pure vanilla extract",
            "1/4 cup water",
            "1/4 cup pine nuts, toasted",

        "instructions": [
            "Toss nectarines with 1 teaspoon sugar and lime juice in a bowl and let macerate, stirring occasionally, 10 to 15 minutes. Pur\u00e9e ricotta, milk, vanilla, and 3 teaspoon sugar in a blender until smooth. Transfer to a bowl and chill in freezer, stirring halfway through, until slightly thickened, 15 to 20 minutes. Line a 4-sided sheet pan with foil. Bring water and remaining 1/2 cup sugar to a boil in a small heavy saucepan over medium heat, stirring until sugar has dissolved, then wash down any sugar crystals from side of pan with a pastry brush dipped in cold water. Boil, without stirring, swirling pan occasionally so caramel colors evenly, until medium amber, 10 to 12 minutes. Stir in pine nuts, then immediately pour out onto foil, quickly spreading with a spatula as thinly as possible. Cool 5 minutes. Peel brittle from foil and break into pieces. Stir mint into nectarines and serve fruit with ricotta cream and pieces of brittle.",
