        "title": "Sweet Potato Pur\u00e9e with Streusel Topping ",
        "ingredients": [
            "5 pounds orange-fleshed sweet potatoes, such as Louisiana, jewel, or garnet yams",
            "3/4 cup all-purpose flour",
            "3/4 cup plus 1/3 cup (packed) light brown sugar",
            "14 tablespoons (1 3/4 sticks) unsalted butter, softened"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Position rack in center of oven and preheat to 400\u00b0F. Butter 9- by 13-inch baking dish or 2-quart casserole. Line rimmed baking sheet with aluminum foil.",
            "Pierce each potato with fork and transfer to baking sheet. Bake until tender, about 50 minutes. Cool until easy to handle.",
            "Meanwhile, make streusel: In medium bowl, combine flour, 3/4 cup brown sugar, and 1 stick butter. Rub mixture between fingertips until blended and crumbly. Set aside.",
            "Halve potatoes lengthwise and scoop out flesh into large bowl. Add remaining 1/3 cup brown sugar and 3/4 stick butter and mash with potato masher or, for a smoother pur\u00e9e, handheld electric mixer. Spread mixture in prepared dish and cool completely. (Streusel and pur\u00e9e can be made up to 2 days ahead and refrigerated, separately, covered.)",
            "Sprinkle streusel over potatoes. Bake until golden brown, about 40 minutes. Let stand 5 minutes before serving. (Completed dish can be prepared up to 1 day ahead and refrigerated, covered. Remove from refrigerator 1 hour before reheating and let come to room temperature. Bake, loosely covered with foil, until heated through, about 25 minutes.)",
            "Variation: Sweet potato pur\u00e9e with marshmallows: Omit streusel. Spread pur\u00e9e in baking dish, cover with foil, and bake until heated through, about 30 minutes. Sprinkle top with 3 cups miniature marshmallows and broil until marshmallows are lightly browned, about 1 minute. Serve immediately.",
