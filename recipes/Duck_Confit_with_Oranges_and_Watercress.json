Whisk together vinegar, lemon juice, sugar, 1/4 teaspoon salt, and 1/8 teaspoon pepper in a bowl. Add oil in a slow stream, whisking until combined. Cook duck, skin side down, covered, in a large heavy nonstick skillet over medium-low heat until skin is well browned and crisp and duck is heated through, 15 to 20 minutes.
