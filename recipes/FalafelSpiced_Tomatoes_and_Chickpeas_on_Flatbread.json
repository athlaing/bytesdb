        "instructions": [
            "Combine garlic, sumac, red pepper flakes, coriander, cumin, and 1 teaspoon salt in a small bowl. Arrange tomato slices in a single layer on a rimmed baking sheet and sprinkle garlic mixture evenly over top. Let sit at room temperature at least 30 minutes and up to 1 hour.",
            "Toss chickpeas and vinegar in a medium bowl; season with salt and pepper. Mash chickpeas with a fork until about half are smashed. Add shallot, parsley, and oil and toss to combine; season with salt and pepper. Set aside.",
            "Yogurt sauce: Combine cucumber, yogurt, mint, and parsley in a medium bowl; season with hot sauce, salt, and pepper. Let sit at room temperature at least 15 minutes.",

            "Do Ahead Yogurt sauce can be made 1 hour ahead. Cover and chill.",
            "Yogurt sauce can be made 1 hour ahead. Cover and chill.",
            "Flatbread and assembly: Whisk salt, baking powder, sugar, and 2 cups flour in a large bowl. Add yogurt and stir to combine (the yogurt's acidity ensures a tender texture). Transfer dough to a lightly floured work surface and knead until mostly smooth, about 1 minute. Divide into 4 pieces, cover with plastic wrap, and let rest 15 minutes (this will make dough easier to roll). Working one at a time, roll out each piece of dough into a round about 1/8\" thick. (Don't stress: They don't need to be perfect.) Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large skillet, preferably cast iron, over medium. Working one at a time, cook rounds of dough until underside is golden brown and flatbread is beginning to puff, about 2 minutes. Flip and cook until other side is golden brown, about 1 minute longer; transfer to a plate. Repeat with remaining oil and rounds of dough. Let cool slightly. Top each flatbread with yogurt sauce, chickpea mixture, and tomatoes. Drizzle with more oil and season well with salt and pepper.",
