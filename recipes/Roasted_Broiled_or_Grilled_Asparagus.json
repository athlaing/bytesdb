        "ingredients": [
            "2 1/2 to 3 pounds asparagus, trimmed and peeled",
            "2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil",
            "Salt to taste",
            "Lemon wedges"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "1. Preheat the oven to 450\u00b0F, preheat the broiler or a gas grill, or start a charcoal or wood fire. If you're roasting or broiling, place the asparagus in a roasting pan and drizzle with a tablespoon or two of oil; sprinkle with salt. If you're grilling, brush the asparagus with oil and sprinkle with salt. Place in the oven, under the broiler, or on the grill.",
            "2. Roast or grill, turning the spears once or twice, just until the thick part of the stalks can be pierced with a knife, 10 to 15 minutes. Broiling time will be shorter, taking 5 to 10 minutes total. Serve immediately or at room temperature, with lemon wedges."
