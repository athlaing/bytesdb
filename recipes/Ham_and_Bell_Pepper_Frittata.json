        "ingredients": [
            "8 large eggs",
            "1/4 cup chopped fresh chives",
            "1/2 teaspoon salt",
            "1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper",
            "2 tablespoons (1/4 stick) butter",
            "1 1/2 cups chopped bell peppers (mix of red, yellow, and green)",
            "4 ounces Black Forest ham, cut into 1/2-inch dice",
            "1 cup grated Swiss cheese"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Whisk eggs, chives, salt, and pepper in medium bowl to blend. Melt butter in large broilerproof skillet over medium heat. Add peppers and ham; saut\u00e9 until peppers are tender, about 5 minutes.",
            "Preheat broiler. Pour egg mixture over peppers and ham in skillet. Cook over medium heat until bottom and edges are set, stirring occasionally, about 3 minutes. Using spatula, carefully lift edges to allow uncooked egg to flow underneath. Reduce heat to medium-low. Lift edges 2 or 3 more times, allowing uncooked egg to flow underneath, until top is almost set, about 2 minutes. Sprinkle cheese over frittata. Transfer skillet to broiler. Broil until cheese is bubbling and eggs are set, about 1 minute. Let frittata stand at least 1 minute and up to 1 hour. Rewarm in microwave oven, if desired, or serve at room temperature."
