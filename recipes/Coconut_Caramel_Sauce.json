        "ingredients": [
            "2 cups sugar",
            "1/2 cup hot water",
            "1/2 cup heavy cream",
            "2 tablespoons unsalted butter",
            "1 cup sweetened flaked coconut, toasted and cooled",
            "2 tablespoons dark rum, or to taste, if desired"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "In a dry large deep heavy skillet cook the sugar over moderately high heat, stirring constantly with a fork, until it is melted and turns a deep golden caramel, remove the skillet from the heat, and into the side of it pour carefully the water and the cream, a little at a time.",
            "Cook the mixture over moderate heat, stirring, until the caramel is dissolved and simmer it for 2 minutes. Remove the skillet from the heat, add the butter and the coconut, and stir the mixture until the butter is melted. Pour the sauce into a heatproof pitcher or glass measure, let it cool slightly, and stir in the rum. (The sauce will thicken as it cools. To return the sauce to liquid state, set the pitcher in a saucepan of barely simmering water and stir the sauce until it reaches the desired consistency.) Serve the sauce warm over ice cream."
