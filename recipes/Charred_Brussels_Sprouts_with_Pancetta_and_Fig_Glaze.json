        "title": "Charred Brussels Sprouts with Pancetta and Fig Glaze ",
        "ingredients": [
            "3 tablespoons olive oil (divided)",
            "3 to 4 ounces pancetta, diced",
            "1 1/2 pounds Brussels sprouts, trimmed and halved (or quartered if large) through the stem end (about 6 cups)",
            "1/4 teaspoon kosher salt",
            "2 tablespoons fig jam",
            "1 tablespoon water",
            "1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "In a large (12 inches or wider) frying pan, heat 1 tablespoon of the oil over medium heat. Add the pancetta and cook, stirring occasionally, for about 3 minutes, until crisp. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the pancetta to a small bowl. Return the pan to medium-high heat and add the remaining 2 tablespoons oil. Add the Brussels sprouts, keeping them in a single layer as much as possible. Having a few extra sprouts is fine, but if they are mounded in a pile, they will not brown or cook evenly. If necessary, use a larger pan, cook them in two batches, or pull out the extra for another use. Stir in the salt. Cook, stirring occasionally, for about 10 minutes, until the Brussels sprouts are tender and well browned\u2014even charred in spots. If the sprouts are browning too quickly, lower the heat to medium.",
            "Add the fig jam and the water and stir until the jam melts and coats the Brussels sprouts. Add the reserved pancetta and the pepper and stir to combine. Taste and add additional salt or pepper if needed. Serve warm."
