        "ingredients": [
            "1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil",
            "4 ounces ramps, white and pink parts finely chopped and greens cut into 1-inch pieces",
            "Kosher salt",
            "1/2 teaspoon black pepper",
            "1 cup heavy cream",
            "1/2 cup finely grated Parmigiano-Reggiano, plus more for sprinkling",
            "8 ounces dried egg tagliatelle or fettuccine"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Heat the oil in a deep heavy skillet (preferably cast-iron) over medium-high heat until it shimmers. Cook the white and pink parts of the ramps with 3/4 teaspoon salt and the pepper, stirring occasionally, until they are golden, about 5 minutes. Add the cream and the ramp greens and boil until the sauce is slightly thickened, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove the skillet from the heat and stir in the Parmesan.",
            "In a large pot of heavily salted boiling water, cook the pasta until it is al dente. Reserve 1 cup of the pasta-cooking water, then drain the pasta.",
            "Add the pasta to the sauce in the skillet, along with 1/4 cup of the cooking water, tossing to coat. Thin the sauce with more cooking water, if you prefer a looser sauce. Serve immediately, with additional cheese for sprinkling."
