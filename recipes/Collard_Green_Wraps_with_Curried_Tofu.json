        "instructions": [
            "Remove dark green tops from scallions and thinly slice on a diagonal. Place in a small bowl, cover with a damp paper towel, and chill until ready to serve. Thinly slice remaining white and pale green parts crosswise and place in another small bowl; add garlic and ginger. (Have scallion mixture, curry paste, tofu, and coconut milk near the stove and at the ready so you can work quickly.)",
            "Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high. Cook scallion mixture, stirring, until just beginning to brown, about 1 minute. Add curry paste and cook, stirring, until it begins to stick to pan, about 1 minute. Add tofu and coconut milk, season with salt, and bring to a simmer. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer gently until sauce is almost completely evaporated and you can see the bottom of skillet, 5\u20137 minutes. Stir in lime juice.",
            "Transfer tofu mixture to a platter and top with chile, if using. Arrange collard greens, cilantro, and reserved scallion tops on platter so that each component is visible and easily accessible. Place coconut chips in a small bowl and arrange lime wedges on a small plate."
