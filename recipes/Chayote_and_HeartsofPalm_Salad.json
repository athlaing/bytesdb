            "1 garlic clove",
            "3/4 teaspoon salt",
            "1/4 cup fresh lime juice",
            "1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil",
            "1/4 cup finely chopped white onion",
            "2 pound chayotes (also called mirlitons; 4 medium)",
            "2 (14- to 15-ounce) cans hearts of palm (not salad-cut), rinsed well and drained",
            "2 large celery ribs, thinly sliced",
            "1/3 cup fresh flat-leaf parsley leaves",

        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Mince garlic and mash to a paste with 1/2 teaspoon salt using side of a large heavy knife. Whisk together lime juice, oil, and garlic paste in a large bowl, then add onion, tossing to coat. Halve chayotes lengthwise, then peel with a vegetable peeler and scoop out pits with a spoon. Cut chayotes crosswise into 1/3-inch-thick slices, then halve slices lengthwise to make 1/3-inch-thick sticks (sticks will not be uniform). Cook chayotes in a 4- to 6-quart pot of boiling salted water until crisp-tender, about 6 minutes. Drain well in a colander, then, while still hot, toss with dressing. Cool to room temperature. Cut hearts of palm diagonally into 1/4-inch-thick slices, then add to chayote mixture along with celery, parsley, cilantro, and remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt. Gently toss.",
