            "Heat 1 Tbsp. oil in a large heavy pot or Dutch oven over medium. Add chorizo and cook, stirring occasionally, until browned and crisp, 2\u20133 minutes. Add onion, fennel, 5 garlic cloves, and 3 Tbsp. oil and cook, stirring often, until vegetables are softened but not browned, 8\u201310 minutes. Add tomatoes, red pepper, and 3/4 tsp. salt and cook, stirring, until warmed through, about 2 minutes longer. Add wine and cook, stirring occasionally, just to burn off some of the alcohol, 1\u20132 minutes. Add mussels and beans and stir once or twice to incorporate. Cover pot and steam until all mussels are open, 3\u20135 minutes. Discard any that do not open. Stir in cilantro. Cut 1 lemon in half and squeeze in 1 Tbsp. lemon juice. Meanwhile, working in batches, heat remaining 2 Tbsp. oil in a large skillet over medium. Add bread and cook until golden brown and crisp on one side, about 2 minutes. Transfer toast to a medium bowl. Rub cooked sides of toast with remaining garlic clove; season with remaining 1/4 tsp. salt. Spoon mussel mixture and broth over toasts. Cut remaining lemon into wedges and serve alongside.",
