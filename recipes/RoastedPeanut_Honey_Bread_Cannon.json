            "two 1/4-ounce packages (5 teaspoons) active dry yeast",
            "1/2 cup warm water (110\u00b0F. to 115\u00b0F.)",
            "1 1/2 cups warm milk (110\u00b0F. to 115\u00b0F.)",
            "1/2 cup honey",
            "1/2 cup creamy peanut butter",

        "instructions": [
            "In a large bowl sprinkle yeast over water and let stand until foamy, about 5 minutes. Add milk, honey and peanut butter and stir until peanut butter is incorporated. Add salt, whole-wheat flour, and peanuts and stir until combined well. Gradually stir in 4 cups all-purpose flour, stirring until mixture forms a dough. Knead dough on a floured surface, incorporating as much of remaining cup all-purpose flour as necessary to prevent dough from sticking, until smooth and elastic, 8 to 10 minutes.",
            "Transfer dough to an oiled deep bowl and turn to coat with oil. Let dough rise, covered with plastic wrap, in a warm place until doubled in bulk, about 1 1/2 hours.",
            "Punch down dough and turn out onto a floured surface. Knead dough 4 times. Divide dough in half and form into loaves. Put each loaf in a lightly oiled loaf pan, about 9 by 5 by 2 inches. Let loaves rise, covered loosely with plastic wrap, in a warm place until doubled in bulk, about 1 hour.",
            "Preheat oven to 350\u00b0F.",
            "Bake loaves in middle of oven 45 to 55 minutes, or until browned and sound hollow when tapped. Cool loaves in pans on racks 30 minutes. Invert loaves onto racks and cool completely."
