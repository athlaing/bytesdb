            "Sauce: Place racks in upper and lower thirds of oven; preheat to 350\u00b0F. Cook garlic and 1/3 cup olive oil in a small saucepan over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally, until garlic is soft enough to easily smash against the side of the pan, 12\u201315 minutes. Let cool. Meanwhile, toast pumpkin seeds on a large rimmed baking sheet on upper rack, tossing occasionally, until golden brown, 8\u201310 minutes. Let cool. Blend cilantro, pumpkin seeds, chile, lime juice, pumpkin seed oil (if using), and garlic oil (with garlic) until smooth. Add a big pinch of salt and blend again.",

            "Rice and assembly: Place rice in a sieve or colander and rinse under running water until water runs clear (this removes surface starch and keeps rice from getting gummy). Combine rice, kombu (if using), and 2 cups water in a medium saucepan; season with salt and let sit 20 minutes. Bring rice to a boil, then reduce heat to low. Cover pan and cook until rice is tender, 30\u201335 minutes (you can also use a rice cooker; follow instructions for correct timing). Remove pan from heat and let sit (still covered) 15 minutes; fluff rice with a fork. Transfer warm rice to a large bowl and stir in 1/4 cup brine. Let rice cool completely, then toss in herbs, oil, lemon zest and juice, and remaining 1/4 cup brine; season with salt and pepper. Serve with sauce drizzled over.",
