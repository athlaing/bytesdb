        "ingredients": [
            "2 1/4 cups unbleached all-purpose flour",
            "1 1/2 teaspoons salt",
            "1 stick (1/2 cup) cold unsalted butter, cut into 1/2-inch cubes",
            "1 large egg",
            "1/3 cup ice water",
            "1 tablespoon distilled white vinegar"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Sift flour with salt into a large bowl and blend in butter with your fingertips or a pastry blender until mixture resembles coarse meal with some (roughly pea-size) butter lumps.",
            "Beat together egg, water, and vinegar in a small bowl with a fork. Add to flour mixture, stirring with fork until just incorporated. (Mixture will look shaggy.)",
            "Turn out mixture onto a lightly floured surface and gather together, then knead gently with heel of your hand once or twice, just enough to bring dough together. Form dough into a flat rectangle and chill, wrapped in plastic wrap, at least 1 hour."
