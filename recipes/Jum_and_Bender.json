            "Halve the passion fruit and push the juice through a coarse sieve to separate the lovely flavor from the seeds. Throw the seeds away but keep all the pulpy juice that will have gathered on the underside of the sieve. Pour into a tall glass and top up with champagne and a dash of grenadine. Cheers!"
