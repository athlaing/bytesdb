            "1/8 teaspoon salt",
            "1/2 cup water",
            "1 large egg, lightly beaten",
            "4 very ripe (completely black) plantains (2 1/2 lb)",
            "1/2 cup granulated sugar",

        "instructions": [
            "Whisk together flour, brown sugar, baking powder, and salt in a large bowl, then add water and egg and whisk until batter is smooth. Peel plantains and cut on a slight diagonal into 1/2-inch pieces. Stir into batter to coat well. Stir together granulated sugar and cinnamon in a shallow bowl. Heat 1/2 inch oil in a 10-inch heavy skillet over moderate heat until thermometer registers 340\u00b0F. (See cooks' note, below.) Fry plantain slices in batches of 6 (don't crowd them) until bottoms are golden, about 45 seconds, then turn over and fry until other side of each is golden, 30 to 45 seconds more. Transfer with a slotted spoon to paper towels to drain. While still warm, toss each batch in sugar mixture until coated, then transfer to a platter. Serve hot or warm.",
