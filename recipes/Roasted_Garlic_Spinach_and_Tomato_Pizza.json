            "1 whole head garlic",
            "3 tsp extra-virgin olive oil",
            "1 package (10 oz) refrigerated pizza dough, such as Pillsbury Refrigerated Pizza Crust",
            "2 cups chopped baby spinach leaves",
            "3/4 cup shredded mozzarella",
            "1/4 cup grated Parmesan",
            "3/4 cup halved cherry tomatoes",
            "1 tbsp pine nuts",
            "Fresh basil leaves"

        "instructions": [
            "Roast the garlic: Slice 1/2 inch off the top of the garlic head and place cut side up on foil. Drizzle with 1 tsp oil and sprinkle with water. Wrap in foil and bake at 350\u00b0F for 50 minutes. When cooled slightly, squeeze roasted garlic out of the skins. To grill: Heat Foreman's Grilling Machine to the highest setting or make a medium-hot fire on a gas or charcoal grill. Roll out pizza dough on a lightly oiled baking sheet. Cut dough in half; shape into two 10-inch square pizzas. Do not make a rim. Grill dough on one side until grill marks show, about 3 minutes. Remove from grill. Place dough, grilled side up, on a cutting board. Brush with remaining 2 tsp oil. Spread with roasted garlic; season with salt and pepper. Add spinach, cheeses, tomatoes, and pine nuts. Return to grill and cook for 3 minutes, or until cheese melts and crust is cooked through. Garnish with basil; cut pizzas in half to serve. To bake: Heat oven to 475\u00b0F. On a lightly greased baking sheet, form dough into a large pizza; arrange toppings. Bake 10 minutes or until crust browns. Remove from oven; garnish with basil; cut into fourths to serve."
