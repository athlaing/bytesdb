            "1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil",
            "1 tablespoon diced shallot, plus 1/4 cup sliced shallots",
            "1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon balsamic vinegar",
            "2 tablespoons red wine vinegar",
            "2 1/2 teaspoons lemon juice",

        "instructions": [
            "Preheat the oven to 400\u00b0F.",
            "Cut off the beet greens, leaving 1/2 inch of the stems still attached. (You can save the leaves for sauteing later\u2014they are delicious!) Clean the beets well, and toss them with 2 tablespoons olive oil and 1 teaspoon salt",
            "Place the beets in a roasting pan with a splash of water in the bottom. Cover the pan tightly with foil, and roast for about 40 minutes, until they're tender when pierced. (The roasting time will depend on the size and type of beet.) When the beets are done, carefully remove the foil. Let cool, and peel the beets by slipping off the skins with your fingers. Cut them into 1/2-inch-thick wedges.",
            "While the beets are in the oven, combine the diced shallot, both vinegars, 2 teaspoons lemon juice, and 1/4 teaspoon salt in a small bowl, and let sit 5 minutes. Whisk in the 1/2 cup olive oil. Taste for balance and seasoning.",
            "Whisk the cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche and horseradish together in a small bowl. Stir in the heavy cream, remaining 1/2 teaspoon lemon juice, \u215b teaspoon salt, and a pinch of pepper.",
            "Toss the beets and sliced shallots with the vinaigrette. (If you're using different-colored beets, dress each color in a separate bowl so the colors don't bleed.) Season with 1/4 teaspoon salt and a pinch of freshly ground black pepper, and toss well. Taste for balance and seasoning."
