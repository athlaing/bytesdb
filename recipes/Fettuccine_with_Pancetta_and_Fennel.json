            "5 ounces thinly sliced pancetta, cut into matchstick-size strips",
            "3 garlic cloves, minced",
            "2 large fennel bulbs, fronds chopped, bulbs cut into 1/4-inch-thick wedges",
            "2 teaspoons fennel seeds",

        "instructions": [
            "Melt butter in heavy large saucepan over medium-low heat. Add pancetta and garlic; saut\u00e9 until garlic is pale golden, about 4 minutes. Stir in 1/3 cup chopped fennel fronds, fennel wedges, fennel seeds and crushed red pepper. Cover and cook until fennel wedges are soft, stirring occasionally, about 15 minutes. Add cream; cook until reduced by half, about 10 minutes.",
            "Meanwhile, cook fettuccine in large pot of boiling salted water until just tender but still firm to bite, stirring occasionally. Drain, reserving 1/2 cup pasta cooking water. Toss pasta with fennel mixture and enough reserved cooking water to coat. Season with salt and pepper. Serve, passing Parmesan cheese separately."
