            "2 tablespoons olive or vegetable oil",
            "1 red onion, chopped",
            "2 stalks celery, chopped",
            "1 pound lump crabmeat",
            "2 teaspoons chopped fresh oregano",
            "1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper",
            "3 cups jarred or fresh Herbed Pumpkin Seed Mole",
            "Twelve 5-to 6-inch corn tortillas",
            "1 cup crumbled cotija cheese",
            "3 green onions, chopped",
            "1 ripe avocado, pitted and sliced"

        "instructions": [
            "Preheat the oven to 375\u00b0F.",
            "Heat the oil in a large skillet over high heat. Add the onions and celery and cook until slightly limp, about 2 minutes. Add the crab, oregano, and pepper and toss until the crabmeat is heated through, just another couple of minutes. Remove from the heat.",
            "Spread 1/2 cup mole verde onto the bottom of a 9-by-13-by-2-inch baking dish.",
            "Stack the tortillas on a microwave-safe plate and cover with a wet paper towel. Microwave on high for 30 to 60 seconds, until softened. Spread the tortillas out onto a couple of large baking sheets or cutting boards.",
            "Spoon some of the crab mixture in a line down the center of each tortilla. Roll them up, placing them seam-side down on the mole verde in the baking dish. Repeat until all of the tortillas are placed in the dish. Pour the remaining mole sauce over the enchiladas and sprinkle with the cheese. Top with the green onions.",
            "Bake until heated through and the cheese melts, about 15 minutes. To serve, transfer 2 enchiladas each onto 6 plates and top each with a couple of avocado slices."
