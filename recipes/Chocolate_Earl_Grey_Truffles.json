        "ingredients": [
            "2/3 cup heavy cream",
            "2 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into 4 pieces and softened",
            "2 teaspoons loose Earl Grey tea leaves",
            "6 oz fine-quality bittersweet chocolate (not unsweetened), chopped",
            "1 cup unsweetened Dutch-process cocoa powder"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Bring cream and butter to a boil in a small heavy saucepan and stir in tea leaves. Remove from heat and let steep 5 minutes.",
            "Meanwhile, finely grind chocolate in a food processor and transfer to a bowl. Pour cream through a fine-mesh sieve onto chocolate, pressing on and discarding tea leaves, then whisk until smooth. Chill ganache, covered, until firm, about 2 hours.",
            "Spoon level teaspoons of ganache onto a baking sheet. Put cocoa in a bowl, then dust your palms lightly with it. Roll each piece of ganache into a ball (wash your hands and redust as they become sticky). Drop several balls at a time into bowl of cocoa and turn to coat. Transfer as coated to an airtight container, separating layers with wax paper."
