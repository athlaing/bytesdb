            "1. Prepare the sp\u00e4tzle: Bring a large pot of water to a boil and salt it until it tastes like sea water (about 2 teaspoons per quart). Whisk the quark, eggs, and yolks together in a large bowl. Use a rubber spatula to stir in the flour until smooth. Season with the salt, nutmeg, and white pepper. 2. Using half of the sp\u00e4tzle dough at a time and working quickly, push the dough through the holes of a colander (or sp\u00e4tzle maker) into the boiling water. Stir the sp\u00e4tzle and cook until the water returns to a simmer, about 1 minute. Then, using a skimmer or a large slotted spoon, transfer the sp\u00e4tzle to another colander. Run cold water over the sp\u00e4tzle to stop them from cooking further. Set that batch of sp\u00e4tzle aside. When the water returns to a boil, make the rest of the sp\u00e4tzle, repeating the procedure. 3. Heat a large cast-iron skillet over medium heat. Add 3 tablespoons of the butter and then the onions. Season with salt and pepper, and cook, stirring occasionally, until soft and light brown, about 15 minutes. Add the garlic and cook until tender, another 2 minutes. Raise the heat to high and add the sp\u00e4tzle. Fry, stirring frequently, until the sp\u00e4tzle begin to turn golden, about 10 minutes. Season with the nutmeg, salt, and pepper. 4. Add the cheese and fry, stirring, until it begins to brown, about 10 minutes. Add 1/2 cup of the beef stock and cook, stirring often, until it is absorbed. Add more stock until a thick, soupy consistency is achieved. 5. Meanwhile, melt the remaining 3 tablespoons butter in a small saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the shallots, season with salt and pepper, and fry until they are brown and slightly crisp. 6. Serve immediately, garnished with the fried shallots and chives.",
