Using electric mixer, beat butter, sugar, coconut extract and salt in large bowl until light and fluffy. Add flour and cornstarch and beat until well blended. Add flaked coconut and stir with fork to blend well. Press dough evenly onto bottom of prepared pan. Using knife dipped into flour and running knife deeply through dough, score dough into 16 equal wedges. Dip fork into flour; run tines across surface of dough wedges from side of pan to center, creating fan pattern. Deeply pierce each wedge in 2 places with fork. Bake shortbread until golden, about 55 minutes. Cool in pan on rack 5 minutes. Remove pan sides. Cut warm shortbread into 16 wedges along marked lines. Cool completely on rack. (Can be made 5 days ahead. Store in airtight container.)",
