            "Have ready a large bowl of ice and cold water. Bring a 6-quart pot three-fourths full of water to a boil, then gently drop peaches into water and cook 15 seconds. Transfer with a slotted spoon to ice water and cool completely to stop cooking. Remove skin with a paring knife and cut peaches into 1/2-inch-thick wedges, discarding pits.",
