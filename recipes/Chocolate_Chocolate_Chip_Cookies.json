            "1 1/4 cups (155 g) whole-wheat pastry flour",
            "1/3 cup (40 g) unsweetened cocoa powder",
            "1/2 teaspoon baking soda",

        "instructions": [
            "Preheat oven to 350\u00b0F (180\u00b0C, or gas mark 4). In a food processor or blender, whip flaxseed and water together until mixture reaches a thick and creamy, almost gelatinous consistency. Set aside.",
            "In a large-size bowl, mix butter and sugar until creamy. Add \"flax egg\" and vanilla.",
            "In a separate bowl, blend flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, baking powder, and salt. Add this dry mixture to the wet mixture, and mix until everything is well blended. If you need a little extra moisture, add a small amount of water or nondairy milk.",
            "Stir in chips. Form balls and flatten slightly on an ungreased cookie sheet. Bake for 7 to 9 minutes, until the tops are no longer gooey."
