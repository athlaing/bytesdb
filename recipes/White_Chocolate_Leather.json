        "title": "White Chocolate Leather ",
        "ingredients": [
            "6 ounces Callebaut or Baker's Premium white chocolate, chopped very fine by hand (about 1 1/8 cups)",
            "1/4 cup light corn syrup"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Put chocolate in a dry wide metal bowl that fits snugly over a 3- to 4-quart saucepan. Fill saucepan halfway with 120\u00b0F. water and immediately set bowl over water. Let chocolate stand undisturbed 15 minutes, or until melted. Stir chocolate just until smooth and remove bowl from pan. Add corn syrup to chocolate and stir with a rubber spatula until mixture thickens and forms a dough. Halve dough and wrap each half in plastic wrap. Let white chocolate leather stand at room temperature until it firms to consistency of clay, about 1 hour and up to overnight, depending on temperature of kitchen. If your kitchen is very warm, leave leather in a cooler place but do not refrigerate. If leather becomes too firm to roll out, try to knead leather in your hands until malleable. If leather is still too firm, microwave at 50% power to 2 to 5 seconds, or until just soft enough to roll out.",
