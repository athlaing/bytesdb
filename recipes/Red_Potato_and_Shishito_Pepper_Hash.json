            "1 1/2 pounds small red potatoes, scrubbed",
            "1 garlic clove, finely grated",
            "1/2 cup mayonnaise",
            "1 1/2 teaspoons Sriracha",
            "1 teaspoon fresh lemon juice",
            "Kosher salt",
            "1/3 cup vegetable oil",
            "15 shishito peppers",
            "1/4 cup crumbled queso fresco",
            "2 scallions, thinly sliced"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Preheat oven to 400\u00b0F. Place potatoes on a foil-lined rimmed baking sheet and roast, turning halfway through, until tender, 30\u201345 minutes. Let cool before cutting in half. Meanwhile, mix garlic, mayonnaise, Sriracha, and lemon juice in a medium bowl to combine; season Sriracha mayonnaise with salt. Heat oil in a large skillet, preferably cast iron, over medium-high. Working in batches if needed to avoid overcrowding the pan, cook potatoes, undisturbed, until deep golden brown and crisp, 6\u20138 minutes. Add shishito peppers, toss to combine, and cook until peppers are lightly blistered in spots, about 2 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer potatoes and peppers to bowl with Sriracha mayonnaise and toss to coat; season generously with salt. Transfer potatoes to a platter and top with queso fresco and scallions.",
