        "ingredients": [
            "1 (4-rib) standing beef rib roast (bone-in prime rib; 9 to 10 pounds), at room temperature 1 hour",
            "2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil",
            "3 tablespoons kosher salt",
            "1/3 cup mixed peppercorns (pink, white, and green)"

        "instructions": [
            "Preheat oven to 450\u00b0F with rack in middle. Rub roast all over with oil, then sprinkle all over with kosher salt. Coarsely crush peppercorns in a folded kitchen towel (not terry cloth) with a meat pounder or bottom of a heavy skillet. Coat meat on all sides with peppercorns, pressing to help them adhere. Roast on a rack in a 13- by 9-inch roasting pan 20 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 350\u00b0F and roast until an instant-read thermometer inserted into center of meat (do not touch bone) registers 110\u00b0F, 1 1/2 to 2 hours more. Transfer to platter and let rest, uncovered, 30 minutes (temperature of meat will rise to about 130\u00b0F for medium-rare).\u25ca",
