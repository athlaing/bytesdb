            "2 lb mussels (35 to 45; preferably cultivated), scrubbed well and beards removed",
            "1/3 cup dry white wine",
            "2 hard-boiled large eggs",
            "2 tablespoons white-wine vinegar",
            "1/4 teaspoon salt",
            "1/4 teaspoon black pepper",
            "1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil",
            "1/2 cup finely chopped celery",
            "1/2 cup pickled cocktail onions, trimmed and finely chopped",
            "2 tablespoons chopped fresh tarragon",

        "instructions": [
            "Cook mussels in wine in a 4- to 6-quart pot over moderately high heat, covered, until mussels just open wide, checking frequently after 4 minutes and transferring opened mussels to a large bowl using a slotted spoon. (Discard any unopened mussels after 8 minutes.) Pour cooking liquid through a fine-mesh sieve into a 1- to 2-quart heavy saucepan and boil until reduced to about 3 tablespoons, about 5 minutes. Transfer to a bowl. Finely chop eggs, then add to reduced liquid along with vinegar, salt, and pepper. Add oil in a slow stream, whisking, then whisk in celery, onions, and tarragon. Season vinaigrette with salt and pepper. Remove mussels from shells and reserve 1 half shell from each mussel. Stir mussels (but not shells) into vinaigrette and marinate, covered and chilled, at least 1 hour. Rinse and dry reserved mussel shells, then chill in a sealed plastic bag until ready to use. Arrange shells on a large platter lined with seaweed and spoon a mussel with some vinaigrette into each.",
