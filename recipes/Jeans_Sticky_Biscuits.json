        "instructions": [
            "1. Grease an 8-inch square baking pan. In a small, heavy saucepan, bring the glaze ingredients to a boil, spoon the mixture into the prepared pan so it completely covers the bottom, and set aside.",
            "2. Preheat the oven to 450\u00b0F.",
            "3. To make the biscuits, whisk together the flour, baking powder, and salt in a large mixing bowl and make a well in the center. In a small mixing bowl, whisk together the oil and milk till well blended, pour into the well, and stir just till a soft dough forms. Transfer the dough to a lightly floured work surface and roll into an 18 x 10-inch rectangle.",
            "4. In a small mixing bowl, mix together the filling ingredients, then sprinkle evenly over the rectangle. Starting from the short side, roll up the rectangle jelly-roll style into an 18-inch-long log, slice into 9 biscuits 2 inches thick, arrange the biscuits cut side down in 3 rows in the glazed pan, and bake till puffed and golden brown, about 20 minutes.",
            "5. Invert the pan immediately onto a large platter so the glaze runs down over the biscuits and serve hot."
