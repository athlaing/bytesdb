        "instructions": [
            "Trim tops off zucchini. Using a mandoline or vegetable peeler, thinly slice lengthwise into wide ribbons; set aside.",

            "Season cutlets on both sides with 1/2 tsp. salt. Dip each in egg mixture, letting excess drip back into bowl, then in cornmeal mixture, shaking off excess.",
            "Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high until shimmering. Working in 2 batches and adding more oil if needed, cook cutlets, shaking pan occasionally, until golden brown and cooked through, about 2 minutes per side. Transfer to a paper-towel lined plate.",
            "Meanwhile, whisk olive oil, lemon juice, red pepper, and remaining 1 tsp. mustard and 1/8 tsp. salt in a large bowl. Add reserved zucchini ribbons and toss gently with your hands until ribbons are evenly coated with dressing. Add mint, cashews, and ricotta salata and toss just to combine.",
            "Transfer cutlets to a platter. Serve with zucchini salad alongside."
