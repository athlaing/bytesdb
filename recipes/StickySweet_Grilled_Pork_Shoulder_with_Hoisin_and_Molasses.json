            "2/3 cup honey",
            "2/3 cup Shaoxing (Chinese rice) wine",

            "1/3 cup oyster sauce",

            "1 (4\u20135-lb.) skinless boneless pork shoulder (Boston butt)",

            "3/4 cup (packed) dark brown sugar",

        "instructions": [
            "Pur\u00e9e garlic, ginger, hoisin sauce, fish sauce, honey, wine, chili oil, oyster sauce, and sesame oil in a blender until very smooth. Place 1 1/2 cups in a small bowl for glaze; cover and chill until ready to use. Pour remaining marinade into a 2-gal. resealable plastic bag.",
            "Place pork shoulder, fat side down, on a cutting board with a short end facing you. Holding a long sharp knife about 1\"\u20131 1/2\" above cutting board, make a shallow cut along the entire length of a long side of shoulder. Continue cutting deeper into meat, lifting and unfurling with your free hand, until it lies flat (it\u2019s better to end up with 2\u20133 even pieces than 1 uneven piece). Add to bag with marinade and seal, pressing out air. Work pork around inside bag to coat with marinade. Chill at least 8 hours and up to 1 day.",
            "Prepare a Big Green Egg for medium heat (with cover closed, thermometer should register 350\u00b0F). Remove pork from marinade, letting excess drip off. Lightly season all over with salt. Fit grill with convection plate and set pork on top. (If you don\u2019t have a convection plate, bank coals on one side and set pork over cooler area to avoid flare-ups.) Cover and roast pork until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part registers 140\u00b0F\u2013145\u00b0F. (You can also do initial cooking in a 350\u00b0F oven.) Transfer to a cutting board and let rest at least 20 minutes.",
            "Glaze and assembly: Bring brown sugar, molasses, and reserved marinade to a simmer in a large saucepan; cook until reduced by one-third, 6\u20138 minutes (you should have about 1 1/3 cups). Keep warm. Prepare a Big Green Egg for medium-high heat (or use a conventional grill). Grill pork, basting and turning with 2 pairs of tongs every minute or so, until thickly coated with glaze, lightly charred in spots, and warmed through (an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part should register 130\u00b0F\u2013145\u00b0F; be careful not to overcook), 6\u20138 minutes. Transfer to a cutting board; slice against the grain \u00bc\" thick. Serve with pickles, bread, cilantro, and onion.",
