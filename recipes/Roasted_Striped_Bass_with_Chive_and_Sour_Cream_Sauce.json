            "1/2 cup finely chopped fresh chives",
            "6 (5-oz) pieces striped bass fillet with skin",

        "instructions": [
            "Blend sour cream, water, juice, salt, and chives in a blender until mixture just turns pale green. Season with pepper.",
            "Prepare fish: Preheat oven to 450\u00b0F. Remove any pin bones from fish with tweezers or needle-nose pliers and pat fish dry with paper towels. Score skin in several places with a thin sharp knife to prevent fish from curling (do not cut through flesh) and season fish with salt and pepper. Heat oil in a 12-inch nonstick skillet over high heat until hot but not smoking, then sear fish, skin sides down, in 2 batches until skin is golden brown and crisp, 3 to 4 minutes (fish will not be fully cooked). Transfer, skin sides up, to an oiled shallow baking pan. Roast fish, uncovered, in middle of oven until just cooked through, 7 to 8 minutes. Spoon 3 tablespoons sauce onto each of 6 plates and top with potatoes and zucchini. Squeeze a lemon wedge over each fillet, then place fish, skin sides up, over vegetables. Top fish with sprouts.",
