        "title": "Mozzarella and Pepper Cooler-Pressed Sandwiches ",
        "ingredients": [
            "1 (5-ounce) jar roasted red bell peppers, drained and roughly chopped",
            "1 pinch hot-pepper flakes (optional for kids)",
            "1 tablespoon roughly chopped Italian parsley, or 1 teaspoon chopped fresh oregano (optional for kids)",
            "1 (6-ounce) container bocconcini in oil (or 3/4 cup fresh mozzarella in oil, torn into pieces), undrained",
            "1/2 thin 18-inch baguette, sliced lengthwise, interior crumb removed"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "1. In a medium bowl, combine the first four ingredients (including the bocconcini's or mozzarella's marinade).",
            "2. Fill the baguette with the mixture.",
            "3. Close the baguette and wrap it tightly in waxed paper, then in aluminum foil.",
            "4. Place the sandwich at the bottom of the cooler so the weight of the other contents compresses the sandwich and allows the juices to soak into the bread."
