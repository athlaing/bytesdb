            "Add 2 inches water to a large wide pot. Set a rack or a few metal cookie cutters in bottom of pot and bring water to a boil. Bring 3 cups additional water to a simmer in a small saucepan. Butter heatproof bowl, then pour 1/4 cup syrup into bottom. Beat together butter and sugar in another bowl with an electric mixer at medium speed until pale and fluffy. Beat in eggs 1 at a time, then add flour and milk alternately in batches, beating until combined. Pour batter over syrup. Cover bowl with a large round of wax paper, then top with foil, crimping tightly around edge. Tie string around rim to secure. Set covered bowl on rack (water should come three fourths of the way up side of bowl; add simmering water if necessary), cover pot, and steam cake over simmering water 1 1/2 hours. Remove bowl from pot and let stand 5 minutes. Discard foil and wax paper. Invert a plate over bowl, then invert cake onto plate. Serve immediately, drizzled with cream and additional syrup.",
