            "In a skillet or large saut\u00e9 pan, heat 4 tablespoons of the olive oil over high heat. Working in batches, brown the pork on all sides, adding more olive oil,l as needed and seasoning with salt and black pepper as you turn the meat. Each batch should take 8 to 10 minutes. When a batch is ready, use a slotted spoon to transfer the pieces to the tagine. Deglaze the pan with about one-half the wine and pour the juices over the meat. In a skillet or saut\u00e9 pan, warm the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil over medium heat and add the onion. Saut\u00e9 for about 10 minutes, until very soft. Add the garlic, fennel seeds, and chile pepper and cook for 3 minutes longer. Add the remaining wine and the tomatoes and simmer for a few minutes to blend the flavors. Transfer the sauce to the tagine along with the pork and its juices. Add the bell peppers, raise the heat to medium, and bring to a gentle boil. Reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer for 1 to 1 1/2 hours, until the pork is meltingly tender. Taste the stew and adjust the seasoning. You can add a few spoonfuls of vinegar for balance.",
