            "3 pints strawberries, hulled",
            "1/2 cup sugar cubes (important to use sugar cubes; it's the best sugar for jam, according to my mother)"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Cook berries in a heavy pan over low heat, stirring every 15 minutes, until jamlike in consistency, about 3 hours. Add sugar, using more (up to 3/4 cup) if you like your jam sweeter, and stir until dissolved. Transfer jam to a jar, let cool and refrigerate. It's a fresh jam, so keep it refrigerated for no more than 2 weeks. Makes about 3 1/2 cups."
