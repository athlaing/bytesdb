        "title": "Triple-Cooked Chips ",
        "ingredients": [
            "1kg Maris Piper potatoes, peeled and cut into chips (approx. 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 6cm)",
            "Groundnut or grapeseed oil",
            "Sea salt"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Place the cut chips into a bowl under running water for 5 minutes to wash the starch off.",
            "Place 2kg cold tap water in a large saucepan and add the potatoes. Place the pan over a medium heat and simmer until the chips are almost falling apart (approximately 20-30 minutes, depending on the potato).",
            "Carefully remove the cooked chips and place them on a cooling rack to dry out. Then place in the freezer for at least 1 hour to remove more moisture.",
            "Heat a deep-fat fryer or a deep pan no more than half filled with oil (to a depth of around 10cm) to 130\u00b0C. Fry the chips in small batches until a light crust forms (approximately 5 minutes), remove from the oil and drain on kitchen paper.",
            "Put the potatoes on a cooling rack and place in the freezer for at least 1 hour. (At this stage, if you don't want to cook and serve immediately, the chips can be kept in the fridge for 3 days.)",
            "Heat the oil in the deep-fat fryer or deep pan to 180\u00b0C and fry the chips until golden (approximately 7 minutes). Drain and sprinkle with sea salt."
