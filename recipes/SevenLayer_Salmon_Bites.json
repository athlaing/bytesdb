        "ingredients": [
            "10 oz whipped cream cheese",
            "1 teaspoon finely grated fresh lemon zest",
            "2 teaspoons fresh lemon juice",
            "2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh chives",
            "1/4 teaspoon salt",
            "1/4 teaspoon black pepper",
            "6 (6- by 5-inch) oval slices dark pumpernickel sandwich bread (about 1/3 inch thick)",
            "1/2 lb thinly sliced Scottish smoked salmon",
            "1/4 cup salmon roe (2 oz)"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Stir together cream cheese, zest, lemon juice, chives, salt, and pepper in a small bowl. Stack bread slices, then trim to form 4 1/4- by 3 1/4-inch rectangles. Arrange rectangles in 1 layer. Spread each with 1 heaping tablespoon cheese mixture and top with a thin layer of smoked salmon (cut to fit with kitchen shears). Make 1 more layer each of cheese and salmon, then top with remaining cheese. Trim edges to make uniform and chill rectangles on a platter until tops are firm, about 1 hour. Cut rectangles into 8 (1 1/2- by 1-inch) pieces, then top each piece with a rounded 1/4 teaspoon roe."
