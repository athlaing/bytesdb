        "ingredients": [
            "2 cups low-sodium vegetable stock",
            "1 cup dried red lentils",
            "1/2 small onion, finely chopped",
            "1 large stalk celery, finely chopped",

            "1. In a medium pot over medium heat, combine the stock, lentils, onion, celery, saffron, salt, and pepper. Bring to a simmer and cook gently until the lentils are tender and light golden in color, 20 to 35 minutes, depending on the lentils. (If they begin to dry out, add water as needed.) Drain, reserving any remaining liquid.",

            "3. Place the dip in a bowl and let cool. Serve with pretzels, crackers, raw vegetables, or chicken tenders."
