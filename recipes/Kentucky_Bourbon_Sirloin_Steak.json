        "ingredients": [
            "3 tablespoons coarsely ground black peppercorns",
            "Four 10-ounce New York-cut sirloin steaks, also called shell steaks",
            "Fine sea salt",
            "2 tablespoons olive oil",
            "1/4 cup finely chopped shallots",
            "1/3 cup Kentucky bourbon",
            "1 cup low-sodium store-bought beef broth",
            "1/2 cup heavy cream",
            "2 tablespoons unsalted butter"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "1. Put the black peppercorns in a wide, flat dish. Press the steaks into the peppers to coat them on all sides, then season with salt. Set aside.",
            "2. Heat the oil in a large, heavy-bottomed saut\u00e9 pan over high heat for 1 minute. Add the steaks, two at a time if necessary to avoid overcrowding, and cook for 3 minutes per side for medium-rare. Transfer each steak to a dinner plate and set aside.",
            "3. Add the shallots to the pan and cook for 2 minutes over medium heat. Remove the pan from the heat and add the bourbon, then carefully return the pan to the stove over low heat and cook until the bourbon is almost entirely evaporated, about 2 minutes. Pour in the broth, raise the heat to high, bring it to a boil, and continue to boil until reduced and thickened, 3 to 5 minutes. Swirl in the cream and the butter and warm gently.",
            "4. Pour some sauce over each steak and serve."
