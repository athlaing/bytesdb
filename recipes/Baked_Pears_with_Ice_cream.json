        "ingredients": [
            "2 firm pears",
            "Juice of half a lemon",
            "1/2 cup apple juice",
            "1/2 cup water",

        "instructions": [
            "1. Preheat the oven to 375\u00b0F.",
            "2. Peel the pears with a vegetable peeler. Cut them in half lengthwise, leaving the stems on two of the halves if possible, and remove cores with a small melon baller. Place in an 8x8-inch baking pan, cut-side down.",
            "3. Combine the lemon juice, apple juice, water, and brown sugar; pour over the pears. Set the pan over medium heat and bring the juices to a boil. Cover the pan with aluminum foil. Bake for 40 minutes (basting after 15 minutes), or until the pears are tender when tested with a toothpick.",
            "4. Chill the pears overnight in the refrigerator, covered with the cooking syrup. Serve in four small dessert bowls to fit, cored-side up, with a small scoop of ice cream in the center of each. Spoon a little of the syrup into each bowl."
