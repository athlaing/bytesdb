            "Heat oven to 350\u00b0. In a bowl, toss tomatoes with 1 tbsp oil, thyme, 1/4 tsp salt and 1/8 tsp pepper. Lightly coat a baking sheet with cooking spray, then arrange tomatoes cut side down. Bake until soft and skins shrivel, about 30 minutes. Heat a large pot over medium heat. Cook bacon, stirring occasionally, until it begins to brown, 4 to 6 minutes. Stir in onion and half the minced garlic. Add carrots and celery. Cook, stirring occasionally, until vegetables soften and begin to color, 7 to 8 minutes. Add beans; cook 2 minutes. Increase heat to medium-high. Stir in broth. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium. Simmer, uncovered, about 15 minutes. Add chicken, 1/4 tsp salt and 1/4 tsp pepper and cook until hot, 2 to 3 minutes. (The stew can be made ahead to this point and kept refrigerated overnight.) Heat 1 1/2 tsp oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Cook shallots, stirring often, until they begin to brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the rest of the garlic and cook 2 to 3 minutes more, until lightly browned; transfer mixture to a bowl. Heat remaining 1 tbsp oil in skillet over medium-high heat. Add spinach in handfuls, turning with tongs to cook evenly. Cook until wilted, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in remaining 1/4 tsp salt and 1/8 tsp pepper and remove from heat. Divide stew (reheated if made ahead), then spinach, among 8 shallow bowls. Lean 2 tomato halves against spinach and spoon some shallot mixture on top. Serve immediately."
