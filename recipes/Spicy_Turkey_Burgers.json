            "2 teaspoons chopped jalape\u00f1o or serrano chile with seeds",

        "instructions": [
            "Cut meat into 1\" cubes; discard skin and bones. Place in a single layer on a rimmed baking sheet, cover with plastic wrap, and transfer to freezer. Chill protein until very cold (it should feel firm but still give when pressed with your finger), about 15 minutes. Meanwhile, place all grinding parts (the stand mixer's grinding attachment, including the dies, or the bowl and blade of the food processor) in the freezer until very cold, at least 15 minutes. Assemble grinder attachment with chilled coarse die. Set a bowl in a large bowl of ice; arrange beneath the attachment to catch ground turkey and keep it cold.",
            "Transfer turkey to a medium bowl. Mix in onion, cilantro, garlic, jalape\u00f1o or serrano chile, coriander, cumin, paprika, and freshly ground black pepper. Grind mixture in batches, with mixer on medium speed, and plunge gently to press through grinder.",
            "Form into four 1/2\"-thick patties. Season with kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper. Grill burgers over medium heat until cooked through, 5-7 minutes per side."
