            "1/3 cup plus 1 teaspoon extra-virgin olive oil",

            "Put oven rack in middle position and preheat oven to 400\u00b0F. Rinse fish and pat dry, then rub inside and out with 1 teaspoon oil and sprinkle with salt. Place opened fish, skin side down, in a large shallow baking dish (13 by 9 by 2 1/2 inches) and bake until fish is just cooked through, about 20 minutes (fish will be opaque). While fish bakes, thinly slice garlic cloves. Heat remaining 1/3 cup oil with garlic in a 10-inch heavy skillet over moderate heat, shaking skillet gently, until garlic is pale golden, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and carefully pour in vinegar (mixture will splatter), then stir to combine. Pour garlic sauce over fish (mixture may splatter).",
