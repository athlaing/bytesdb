        "ingredients": [
            "1 cup olive oil",
            "6 oz shallots, thinly sliced (1 1/3 cups)",
            "1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice",
            "1/4 teaspoon salt",
            "1/8 teaspoon black pepper",
            "1/2 cup packed pitted prunes (5 oz), finely chopped",
            "1 head escarole (1 lb), tough ribs and outer leaves discarded and inner leaves and tender ribs cut crosswise into 1/2-inch-wide strips (8 cups)"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Heat oil in a 1-quart heavy saucepan over moderate heat until hot but not smoking, then fry shallots in 3 batches, stirring frequently and being careful not to burn, until golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes. Transfer shallots as browned with a slotted spoon to paper towels to drain. (Shallots will crisp as they cool.) Transfer 3 tablespoons shallot oil from pan to a cup for dressing and reserve remainder for another use.",
            "Whisk together lemon juice, salt, and pepper in a large bowl, then add shallot oil in a slow stream, whisking until combined. Add prunes, escarole, half of shallots, and salt to taste, then toss well to coat. Sprinkle with remaining shallots."
