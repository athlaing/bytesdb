        "ingredients": [
            "6 tablespoons raw hazelnuts",
            "3 tablespoons unsalted butter, divided",
            "3 large shallots, sliced (about 1 cup)",
            "3/4 teaspoon kosher salt",
            "1/2 teaspoon freshly ground pepper",
            "1 1/2 pounds haricots verts (thin green beans), trimmed",
            "3 tablespoons fresh tarragon leaves, coarsely chopped",
            "1 1/2 teaspoons grated lemon zest"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Preheat oven to 350\u00b0F. Spread hazelnuts on a baking sheet and toast in the oven, tossing halfway through, until skins are splitting and nuts are fragrant, about 15 minutes. Transfer to a bowl to steam and cool, then rub the nuts with a kitchen towel to remove their skins. Roughly chop the hazelnuts and set aside. In a large saut\u00e9 pan over medium-high heat, melt 1 tablespoon butter. Add shallots and cook, tossing, until lightly golden and softened, 3 to 4 minutes. Remove and set aside. Reduce heat to medium, and add 1/2 cup water, remaining 2 tablespoons butter, salt, and pepper to the same pan. Add the haricots verts and toss to coat. Cover pan and cook, tossing occasionally, until bright green and crisp-tender, about 3 minutes. Remove cover, raise heat to high and cook until the water evaporates and the beans are glazed, about 3 minutes more. Toss green beans with tarragon, lemon zest, hazelnuts, and saut\u00e9ed shallots. Serve immediately.",
