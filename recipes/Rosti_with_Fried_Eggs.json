        "ingredients": [
            "3 russet potatoes (about 1 1/2 pounds)",
            "Kosher salt",
            "6 tablespoons (3/4 stick) unsalted butter, divided",
            "Freshly ground black pepper",
            "4 ounces raclette or Gruy\u00e8re cheese, sliced",
            "4 large eggs",
            "Chopped flat-leaf parsley"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Place potatoes in a large saucepan, add cold water to cover, and season generously with salt. Bring to a boil; reduce heat and simmer until the tip of a paring knife slides easily about 1/2\" into potatoes, 8-10 minutes. Drain potatoes and let cool. Chill until firm, about 2 hours. Preheat oven to 300\u00b0F. Peel potatoes. Using the large holes of a box grater, grate potatoes. Melt 4 tablespoons butter in a 12\" ovenproof skillet over medium-low heat. Add potatoes. Season with salt and pepper; press gently to compact. Cook, occasionally shaking pan to loosen, until bottom is golden brown and crisp, 15-20 minutes. Slide r\u00f6sti onto a plate. Carefully invert skillet over plate and flip to return r\u00f6sti to pan, browned side up. Dot 1 tablespoon butter around edge, allowing it to melt around and under r\u00f6sti. Season with salt and pepper and cook until second side is golden brown and center is tender, 10-15 minutes longer. Top r\u00f6sti with cheese and bake until cheese melts, 5-8 minutes. Meanwhile, melt remaining 1 tablespoon butter in a large nonstick skillet over medium-low heat. Crack eggs into skillet and cook until whites are just set, about 4 minutes. Cut r\u00f6sti into quarters, top with eggs, and garnish with parsley.",
