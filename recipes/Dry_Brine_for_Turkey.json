            "3 to 6 tablespoons Diamond Crystal kosher salt or 2 to 5 tablespoons Morton's kosher salt",
            "1 (12- to 14- pound) turkey,* neck and giblets removed",

        "instructions": [
            "Arrange the turkey on a large rimmed baking sheet or in a large roasting pan. Sprinkle some salt in the cavity and then liberally all over the turkey, making sure to season the back, joints, legs, and thighs, as well as the breast. Loosely cover the turkey with plastic wrap and refrigerate at least 12 hours and up to 2 days. (You can also place the salted turkey in a large plastic bag and seal with a twist tie.) If possible, leave the turkey uncovered for the last 6 hours, to dry out the skin (if not, just be sure to pat it dry before roasting). Remove the turkey from the refrigerator\u2014don't rinse it\u2014and let it sit at room temperature for an hour or so before roasting according to your favorite recipe."
