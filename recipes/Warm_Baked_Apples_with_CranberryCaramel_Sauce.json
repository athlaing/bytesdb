Stand apples in 11 x 7-inch glass baking dish, trimming apple bottoms if necessary to create flat surface.",
            "Bring 3/4 cup cream, cranberry juice concentrate, sugar, and butter to boil in heavy medium saucepan, stirring until sugar dissolves. Pour syrup over apples, adding some to hollow centers. Bake apples until tender, basting once, about 1 hour.",
