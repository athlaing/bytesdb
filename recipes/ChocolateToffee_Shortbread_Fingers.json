        "ingredients": [
            "1/2 cup toasted and cooled pecans, coarsely chopped",
            "3/4 cup Heath Bits 'O Brickle Toffee bits or Skor or Heath bars, coarsely chopped",
            "1 bag (12 ounces) bittersweet or semisweet chocolate chips",
            "1 tablespoon vegetable oil",
            "4 packages (8.8-ounces each) Walkers Pure Butter Shortbread Fingers"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "1. Line a few baking sheets with parchment paper. Combine the nuts and toffee bits in a shallow bowl.",
            "2. Combine the chocolate and oil in a small microwave-safe bowl. Heat the chocolate in the microwave on high until melted, 30 seconds to 1 minute depending on the strength of your microwave. Stir until smooth. (Alternatively, place water to a depth of 1 inch in the bottom of a double boiler or a large saucepan and bring to a bare simmer. Place the chocolate chips and oil in the top of the double boiler or in a stainless steel bowl big enough to rest on top of the saucepan without touching the water. Heat, whisking occasionally, until the chocolate is melted.)",
            "3. Hold a cookie by one end and dip it into the chocolate, turning, to coat three quarters of the cookie; let the excess drip back into the bowl. Hold the cookie over the bowl of nuts and toffee bits and sprinkle some of the mixture onto the chocolate-coated top and sides of the cookie. Place the cookie on a prepared baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining cookies. Let the cookies rest until the chocolate is set, about 30 minutes.",
            "Chocolate-Toffee Shortbread Fingers will keep, between layers of parchment paper, in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 1 week",
            "Note: To toast the pecans, place them in a single layer on an ungreased baking sheet and bake in a 350\u00b0F oven, shaking the pan occasionally, until fragrant, 5 to 10 minutes. Watch them closely to make sure they don't burn, and transfer the toasted nuts to a plate to let them cool.",
