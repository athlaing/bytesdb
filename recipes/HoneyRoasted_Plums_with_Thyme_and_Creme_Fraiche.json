        "ingredients": [
            "1/2 cup (packed) dark brown sugar",
            "1/4 cup honey",
            "4 tablespoons (1/2 stick) unsalted butter",
            "1/2 cup fresh thyme sprigs",
            "6 large assorted ripe but firm plums (about 2 pounds), halved, pitted",
            "Cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche",
            "Additional fresh thyme sprigs"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Preheat oven to 475\u00b0F. Stir first 4 ingredients in large ovenproof nonstick skillet over high heat until butter melts. Cook 2 minutes, stirring constantly (mixture will bubble vigorously). Add plum halves, cut side down. Cook plums without stirring for 2 minutes. Turn plums over and transfer skillet to oven. Roast until caramel is deep brown, checking frequently to prevent burning, about 4 minutes.",
            "Divide plum halves among 6 plates. Spoon sauce from skillet over plums, leaving most of thyme sprigs behind. Drizzle plums with cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche, garnish with additional thyme sprigs, and serve."
