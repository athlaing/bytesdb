        "ingredients": [
            "2 tablespoons olive oil",
            "1 leek stalk (light part only), sliced thin",
            "1/2 cup fresh peas, blanched and drained",
            "6 large eggs",
            "1 small bunch fresh mint, stems removed, torn into small pieces",
            "Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste",
            "2 ounces ricotta salata, crumbled (or fresh ricotta or goat cheese)"

        "instructions": [
            "1. Preheat oven to 425\u00b0F.",
            "2. Heat the oil in a large ovenproof saut\u00e9 pan over medium heat. Add the leek and saut\u00e9 until soft, then add the peas and cook for 2 to 3 minutes more.",
            "3. Meanwhile, in a medium bowl, beat the eggs with 1 tablespoon water.",
            "4. Add the eggs and half the mint to the pan, season with the salt and pepper, and cook, lifting the edges with a spatula to allow the uncooked eggs to flow to the bottom. When the frittata is partly cooked (7 to 10 minutes), sprinkle on the ricotta and transfer the pan to the oven.",
            "5. Bake until puffed, golden, and set, 8 to 10 minutes. Remove and allow to cool slightly. Garnish with the remaining mint to taste and serve."
