            "Start by making the curried cauliflower. Preheat the oven to 425\u00b0F (220\u00b0C/gas mark 7). In a bowl, toss the cauliflower with the spices, thyme leaves and olive oil, mixing well. Transfer to an ovenproof dish and roast in the oven for 10-15 minutes, until lightly brown on top. Remove from the oven and set aside to cool.",
