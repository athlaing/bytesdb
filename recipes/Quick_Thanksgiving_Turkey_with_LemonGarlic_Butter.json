        "ingredients": [
            "3/4 cup (1 1/2 sticks) unsalted butter",
            "6 garlic cloves, pressed",
            "2 tablespoons finely grated lemon zest",
            "3 sprigs rosemary",
            "2 bone-in turkey legs (thigh and drumstick attached) and 2 bone-in turkey breasts (about 8 pounds total; from one 10\u201312-lb. turkey)",
            "1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more",
            "1 tablespoon freshly ground black pepper, plus more",
            "1 cup dry white wine, divided",
            "1 tablespoon cornstarch",
            "2 cups low-sodium chicken or turkey broth"

        "instructions": [
            "Preheat oven to 425\u00b0F. Cook butter, garlic, lemon zest, and rosemary in a small pot over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until butter is melted. Reduce heat to low and let simmer to infuse flavors, about 5 minutes. Brush turkey generously with butter mixture on all sides and under skin, getting some garlic and lemon zest under skin\u2014that\u2019ll make it taste so much better. Season turkey with 1 Tbsp. plus 1 tsp. salt and 1 Tbsp. pepper on all sides and arrange skin side up on a rimmed baking sheet. Pour 1/2 cup wine around turkey pieces. Cover with foil and roast turkey 20 minutes. Uncover, brush tops of each piece with butter mixture, and continue to roast until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of each piece registers 165\u00b0F, 40\u201350 minutes. Some pieces might be done before others, so test each one. Let turkey rest 20 minutes before slicing. Meanwhile, strain pan drippings through a fine-mesh sieve into a heatproof measuring cup or bowl. Skim fat off surface (or use a fat separator if you have one). You should have about 1/2 cup drippings. Whisk in cornstarch until smooth. Bring remaining 1/2 cup wine to a boil in a large skillet over high heat. Cook until reduced by half, about 3 minutes. Add broth and continue to cook, stirring occasionally, until reduced slightly, about 5 minutes. Whisk in turkey drippings and bring to a boil. Cook, stirring occasionally, until thick enough to coat the back of a spoon, about 6 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Transfer turkey to a platter. Serve with pan sauce alongside.",
