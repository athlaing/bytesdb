        "ingredients": [
            "1 tablespoon sugar",
            "2 tablespoons unsalted butter",
            "2 pounds parsnips, peeled, cored, and cut into 1/4-inch-thick sticks",
            "1/4 cup Moscatel vinegar or balsamic vinegar",
            "1/2 cup water"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Heat sugar in center of a 12-inch heavy skillet over medium heat until it starts to melt. Cook, tilting skillet occasionally so sugar melts evenly, until golden brown. Stir in butter, then add parsnips and cook, stirring, 2 minutes. Add vinegar, water, 3/4 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper.",
            "Reduce heat to low and simmer, covered, until parsnips are just tender, 10 to 15 minutes. Remove lid and simmer, stirring occasionally, until liquid is reduced to a glaze and parsnips are caramelized, about 5 minutes. Serve warm or at room temperature."
