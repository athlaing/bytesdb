            "1 tablespoon pure maple syrup",
            "1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon",
            "1/4 teaspoon sea salt",

        "instructions": [
            "Line a mini muffin pan with paper liners and set aside.",
            "In a bowl, whisk together the almond butter, maple syrup, cinnamon, sea salt, and coconut flour until well combined; a smooth, thickish paste should form. Cover and chill in the refrigerator or freezer until thickened; 10 to 15 minutes.",
            "Remove from the freezer and roll into a log. Break into 24 equal pieces and mold each piece into a flat disk slightly smaller than the cups in the muffin pan. Set aside.",
            "Melt together the chocolate chips and coconut oil over a double boiler or in a microwave in 10-second increments, stirring until smooth.",
            "Drop a teaspoon of melted chocolate into each of the prepared cups, and shake/tap the pan to create a smooth, even layer.",
            "Place the disks of filling on top of the chocolate, and top with the remaining chocolate. Tap to eliminate air bubbles.",
            "Sprinkle with the flaky salt and freeze until set. Let come to room temperature before serving."
