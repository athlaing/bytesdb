            "Lightly coat an 8 1/2x4 1/2\" loaf pan with nonstick spray and line with parchment paper, leaving a 2\" overhang on long sides. Lightly coat parchment with nonstick spray. Cook sugar, sweetened condensed milk, molasses, butter, salt, and 3 Tbsp. water in a medium saucepan over medium heat, stirring with a heatproof rubber spatula, until sugar is dissolved, butter is melted, and mixture is smooth. Fit saucepan with thermometer and bring mixture to a boil, stirring constantly and scraping bottom with spatula to keep mixture from burning, until thermometer registers 246\u00b0F. Remove pan from heat and stir in anise extract and food coloring, if using, then immediately pour into prepared pan and sprinkle with sea salt. Loosely cover pan with plastic wrap and let sit until caramel is cool and set, at least 2 hours.",
