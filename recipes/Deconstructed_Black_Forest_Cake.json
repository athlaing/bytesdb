            "For chocolate fudge pots: Preheat oven to 325\u00b0F. Place chocolate in bowl. Bring cream and salt just to boil in medium saucepan. Pour over chocolate; whisk until melted. Whisk yolks and sugar in bowl to blend; whisk in hot chocolate mixture. Transfer mixture to same saucepan. Cook over medium-low heat until slightly thickened, stirring constantly, about 5 minutes (do not boil). Divide chocolate custard among ten 1/3-cup ramekins (about 1/4 cup in each). Place ramekins in large roasting pan. Add enough water to pan to come halfway up sides of ramekins. Cover pan tightly with foil. Bake until custards are almost set, about 37 minutes. Remove ramekins from pan; cool 15 minutes. Chill uncovered until cold, about 3 hours. (Can be made 1 day ahead.)",

            "For cherry compote: Stir cherries and 2/3 cup sugar in large saucepan over medium heat 2 minutes. Add wine; simmer until slightly reduced, about 4 minutes.
