        "ingredients": [
            "1 pound ramps",
            "1/4 cup (1/2 stick) unsalted butter",
            "Kosher salt, freshly ground pepper",
            "1 tablespoon distilled white vinegar",
            "4 large eggs",
            "4 1/2\"-thick slices country-style bread",
            "2 tablespoons olive oil, plus more for drizzling",
            "4 ounces fresh goat cheese, room temperature",
            "Flaky sea salt (such as Maldon)"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Cut dark-green leaves from ramps and slice crosswise 1\" thick; slice bulbs and red stems crosswise 1/4\" thick.",
            "Heat butter in a medium skillet over medium heat. Add bulbs and stems, season with salt and pepper, and cook, stirring often, until beginning to soften, 5\u20138 minutes. Add tops and cook, stirring often, until soft, about 3 minutes.",
            "Meanwhile, bring 2\" water to a boil in a large saucepan; reduce heat so water is at a gentle simmer and add vinegar. Crack an egg into a small bowl, then gently slide egg into water. Repeat with remaining eggs, waiting until whites of eggs in water are opaque before adding the next egg (about 30 seconds apart). Poach until whites are set but yolks are still runny, about 3 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer eggs to paper towels as they are done.",
            "Toast bread, brush with 2 tablespoons oil, and season with kosher salt. Spread toasts with goat cheese and top with ramps and eggs. Drizzle with more oil and season with sea salt and pepper."
