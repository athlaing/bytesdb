            "Peaches Using the tip of a paring knife, score an X in the bottom of each peach. Cook in a large pot of boiling water just until skins begin to peel back where cut, about 1 minute. Using a slotted spoon, transfer to a bowl of ice water; let cool. Peel; cut over a medium bowl into 1/4\"-thick wedges, collecting juices. Add tarragon and sugar to peaches and toss to combine. Let stand, tossing occasionally, until peaches release their juices and sugar is dissolved, about 1 hour.",

            "Shortcake and assembly: Preheat oven to 425\u00b0. Heat butter and tarragon in a small saucepan over medium heat until butter is melted; set aside. Whisk cake flour, baking powder, salt, 1 cup all-purpose flour, and 2 teaspoons sugar in a large bowl. Drizzle chilled cream over and mix gently until dough holds together. Turn out dough onto a lightly floured surface and knead into a shaggy ball, being careful not to overwork. Place on a parchment-lined rimmed baking sheet and form into an 8\"-diameter disk, about 1/2\" thick. Brush with some reserved melted butter and sprinkle with sugar. Bake until shortcake edges are golden brown, 12\u201315 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 325\u00b0. Bake until golden brown all over, 8\u201310 minutes longer. Brush shortcake with remaining melted butter. Transfer to a wire rack and let cool. Cut shortcake into 8 wedges, spoon peaches and their juices over, and top with whipped cream.",
