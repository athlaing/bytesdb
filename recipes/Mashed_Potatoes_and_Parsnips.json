            "8 medium red or white new potatoes, washed and cubed.",
            "4 parsnips, peeled and cubed",
            "1 cup milk",
            "3 tablespoons butter",
            "1 tablespoon chopped parsley",
            "Dash cayenne pepper",
            "Several grindings of black pepper",
            "1 teaspoon salt"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Put the potatoes and parsnips in a large pot with water, making sure that the water completely covers them. Bring to a boil, lower the heat to medium, then cover and simmer for 20-30 minutes, stirring occasionally with a spoon. Test the tenderness of the potatoes with a fork; they should pierce easily and be tender, yet firm. Drain any remaining liquid and mash the potatoes with a potato masher until there are no visible lumps. Add the milk and butter and continue to mash until the potatoes are smooth and creamy. Stir in the parsley, cayenne pepper, black pepper, and salt, and beat thoroughly with a wooden spoon until all the seasonings are completely mixed in. Cover and serve warm.",
