        "ingredients": [
            "12 medium-sized strawberries",
            "8 large marshmallows",
            "8 slices French baguette",
            "Olive oil, for brushing",
            "One (4-ounce) bar dark chocolate, cut into 8 pieces",
            "1/4 teaspoon coarse kosher or sea salt"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Prepare a medium-hot fire on one side of your grill.",
            "Thread the strawberries and marshmallows alternately on 4 skewers (if using wooden skewers, pre-soak them). Lightly brush the slices of bread with olive oil.",
            "Place the skewers directly over the fire and grill for about 4 or 5 minutes until the marshmallows have browned.",
            "At the same time, grill one side of the bread. Turn the slices over and move to the indirect side of the grill. Place a piece of chocolate on each slice and sprinkle with a pinch of coarse salt. Remove from the grill when the chocolate is soft but still holds its shape.",
            "Serve the skewers with the grilled bread for a grown-up version of s'mores."
