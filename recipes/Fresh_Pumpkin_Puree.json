        "title": "Fresh Pumpkin Pur\u00e9e ",
        "ingredients": [
            "an 8-pound pumpkin (preferably a sugar pumpkin)",
            "1 1/2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Slice off the stem end of the pumpkin 2 1/2 inches from the top, reserving it, scrape out the seeds and the membranes, reserving the seeds for toasting if desired, and brush the inside of the pumpkin with the butter. Top the pumpkin with the reserved stem end, bake it in a shallow baking pan in the middle of a preheated 375\u00b0F. oven for 1 1/2 hours, or until the pulp is tender, and let it cool in the pan until it can be handled. Discard any liquid that may have accumulated in the pumpkin, scoop out the pulp, and in a blender pur\u00e9e it in batches, transferring it as it is pur\u00e9ed to a large sieve or colander lined with overlapping large coffee filters and set over a large bowl. Cover the surface of the pur\u00e9e with plastic wrap and let the pur\u00e9e drain, chilled, overnight."
