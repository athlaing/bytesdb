        "ingredients": [
            "5 russet potatoes (about 3 pounds), peeled, coarsely shredded",
            "1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt",
            "1/4 teaspoons freshly ground black pepper",
            "8 tablespoons vegetable oil, divided",
            "2 bunches scallions, greens and whites separated, thinly sliced",
            "Coarse sea salt (such as Maldon)"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Rinse potatoes in a colander under cold water until water runs clear. Squeeze firmly to remove excess liquid. Transfer to a large bowl. Add salt and pepper; toss to coat. Heat 6 tablespoons oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add half of potatoes; press gently into an even layer. Sprinkle with scallion whites. Top with remaining potatoes; press gently again. Cook until golden brown on bottom and sides, 10-15 minutes. Slide hash browns onto a plate. Carefully place skillet upside down over hash browns and flip to invert into skillet, browned side up. Drizzle remaining 2 tablespoons oil around sides of skillet. Cook hash browns until bottom is golden brown, 10-15 minutes longer; slide onto a plate and season with sea salt. Top with scallion greens and cut into wedges. DO AHEAD: Hash browns can be made 1 hour ahead. Place on a wire rack set inside a large rimmed baking sheet and keep them in a 200\u00b0F oven. Top with scallions before serving.",
