            "4 (1/2-inch-thick) round slices fresh pineapple (1/2 pineapple)",
            "1/4 cup mild olive oil or vegetable oil",
            "1 medium red onion, finely chopped (1 cup)",

        "instructions": [
            "Set the oven to broil (alternatively, you can preheat the oven to 500\u00b0F) and preheat, or heat a lightly oiled grill pan over medium heat. If you're using the oven broiler, position the rack 8 inches from the heat source.",
            "Brush the pineapple slices with some of the oil and roast or grill them until they're browned on both sides and tender, 5 to 6 minutes a side on the grill pan, or 8 minutes a side under the broiler. Let them cool to room temperature.",
            "Dice the pineapple (about 1/8 inch), discarding the core, and mix it in a bowl with the remaining ingredients. Season to taste with additional lime juice and salt.",
