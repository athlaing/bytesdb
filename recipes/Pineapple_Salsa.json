            "2 cups fresh pineapple cut into 1/2-inch cubes",
            "3 tablespoons thinly slivered fresh mint or lemon verbena",
            "1 to 2 jalape\u00f1o peppers (preferably red), seeded and minced (for a hotter \"salsa,\" leave the seeds in)",
            "2 tablespoons fresh lime juice, or more to taste",
            "1 tablespoon light brown sugar, or more to taste"

            "Place the pineapple, mint, jalape\u00f1o(s), lime juice, and brown sugar in a nonreactive mixing bowl, but don't mix them until 5 minutes before you are ready to serve. Taste for seasoning, adding more lime juice and/or brown sugar as necessary.",
            "Variation: Slivered mint keeps this \"salsa\" in the realm of a salad. If you really want to push the limits try substituting chopped fresh cilantro for the mint.",
