        "ingredients": [
            "Sweet pastry dough for a single-crust pie",
            "1/2 cup heavy cream",
            "1/2 cup plus 1 tablespoon sugar",
            "1 teaspoon finely grated fresh lemon zest",
            "1/2 cup fresh lemon juice",
            "4 large egg yolks",
            "1 whole large egg",
            "a 9 1/2-inch round fluted tart pan (1 inch deep) with a removable bottom; pie weights or raw rice; a small blowtorch"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Roll out dough into a 13-inch round on a lightly floured surface with a lightly floured rolling pin. Fit into tart pan and trim edges. Chill shell until firm, about 30 minutes. Put oven rack in middle position and preheat oven to 375\u00b0F. Lightly prick bottom of shell all over with a fork, then line with foil and fill with pie weights. Bake until side is set and edge is pale golden, 18 to 20 minutes. Carefully remove foil and weights and bake shell until deep golden, 15 to 20 minutes more. Remove from oven and reduce oven temperature to 300\u00b0F. Whisk together cream, 1/2 cup sugar, zest, juice, yolks, and whole egg until combined. Put tart shell (in tart pan) on a large baking sheet and transfer to oven. With oven rack extended, carefully pour filling into tart shell (custard will still have bubbles on top), then carefully slide rack into oven. Bake tart until custard is set 3 inches from edge but trembles slightly in center when gently shaken, 25 to 35 minutes. Remove from baking sheet and cool in pan on a rack 30 minutes, then remove side of pan and cool to room temperature, about 1 1/4 hours. Just before serving, sprinkle remaining tablespoon sugar evenly over top of tart. Move blowtorch flame evenly back and forth just above top of tart, avoiding crust, until sugar is caramelized and slightly browned (be careful not to burn sugar). Let tart stand 5 minutes before serving.",
