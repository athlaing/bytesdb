            "1/3 cup heavy cream",
            "4 ounces feta, divided",
            "Kosher salt, freshly ground pepper",
            "1 (14-ounce [1 sheet] or 17.3-ounce [2 sheets]) package frozen puff pastry, thawed",
            "All-purpose flour (for work surface)",
            "2 (4-ounce) jars marinated artichoke hearts, drained, halved",
            "2 tablespoons olive oil",
            "1 large egg, beaten to blend"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Preheat oven to 425\u00b0F. Blend cream and 2 ounces feta in a food processor until smooth; season with salt and pepper. If using 14-ounce package of puff pastry, cut in half and roll out each half on a lightly floured surface into a 16x10\" rectangle. (If using 17.3-ounce package, use 1 sheet of pastry for each tart.) Transfer each piece of pastry to a parchment-lined baking sheet. Using a paring knife, lightly score pastry (do not cut all the way through), leaving a 1\" border. Spread feta mixture over pastry, dividing evenly and staying within border. Arrange artichoke hearts over feta mixture and crumble remaining 2 ounces feta over; drizzle with oil. Brush pastry border with egg. Bake tart until pastry is puffed and beginning to brown, 10-15 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 375\u00b0F and continue to bake until pastry is deep golden brown and cooked through, 20-25 minutes longer. Serve warm or at room temperature.",

            "Variations: The feta and puff pastry in this tart pair well with any number of toppings. In place of the artichokes, try: Red Pepper + Olive: Scatter feta cream with jarred roasted red peppers, black olives, and chopped fresh rosemary, then bake. Finish with a drizzle of olive oil. Asparagus + Egg: Top cheese with asparagus that's been halved lengthwise. Once out of the oven, slide on a few fried eggs. Smoked Salmon + Scallion: Bake tart with feta only. When slightly cooled, add smoked salmon and sliced scallions.",
