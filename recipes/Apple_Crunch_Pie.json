            "Roll out dough on lightly floured sheet of parchment paper to 14-inch round, occasionally lifting and turning dough to prevent sticking. Transfer dough on parchment to rimless baking sheet. Leaving 2-inch plain border, spread preserves over center of dough. Sprinkle preserves with 3/4 cup topping mixture. Spoon apple mixture over topping, mounding slightly in center; sprinkle apples with remaining topping. Using parchment as aid, fold dough border in over apple filling (border will not cover filling completely). Press border firmly to hold shape and keep in place. Carefully peel back parchment. Brush border generously with glaze. Bake pie until crust is set, about 25 minutes. Reduce temperature to 325\u00b0F. Bake until apples are tender, covering topping loosely with foil if browning too quickly, about 40 minutes longer. Cool pie on baking sheet at least 30 minutes. Serve warm or at room temperature.",
