        "ingredients": [
            "3/4 cup whole milk",
            "3/4 cup water",
            "1/4 cup (1/2 stick) unsalted butter, room temperature",
            "3 cups (or more) white whole wheat flour* or regular whole wheat flour",
            "3/4 cup instant mashed potato flakes",
            "1/4 cup nonfat dry milk powder",
            "3 tablespoons sugar",
            "2 1/4 teaspoons quick-rising active dry yeast (from two 1/4-ounce envelopes)",
            "1 1/4 teaspoons salt",
            "1 large egg yolk",
            "1 large egg white, whisked with 1 tablespoon water (for glaze)",
            "3 to 4 tablespoons quick-cooking oats"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Bring 3/4 cup whole milk and 3/4 cup water to simmer in small saucepan. Remove from heat. Add butter; stir until melted. Attach instant-read thermometer to inside of pan; let milk cool until thermometer registers 120\u00b0F to 130\u00b0F.",
            "Meanwhile, combine 3 cups flour, potato flakes, dry milk powder, sugar, yeast, and salt in large bowl; whisk to blend. Add warm milk mixture. Stir to blend; mix in egg yolk. Knead mixture in bowl until dough comes together (dough will be sticky). Turn out onto floured work surface and knead until very smooth, elastic, and no longer sticky, adding more flour by tablespoonfuls as needed, about 8 minutes. Place dough in buttered bowl; turn to coat. Cover bowl with plastic wrap, then kitchen towel. Let rise in warm draft-free area until doubled in volume, about 1 to 1 1/2 hours.",
            "Butter 13x9x2-inch metal baking pan or small baking sheet. Turn dough out onto floured work surface and divide in half. Knead each piece lightly until smooth. Cut each dough half into 8 equal pieces. Roll each piece into almost smooth ball. Arrange dough rounds in 4 lengthwise and 4 crosswise rows in prepared pan, spacing about 3/4 to 1 inch apart (rolls will not fill pan). Cover shaped rolls with kitchen towel and let rise in warm draft-free area until rolls have almost doubled in volume and have expanded enough to touch each other, about 1 hour 15 minutes.",
            "Position rack in center of oven and preheat to 350\u00b0F. Gently brush rolls with egg-white glaze, then sprinkle generously with oats. Bake dinner rolls until light golden brown, about 28 minutes. Let rolls cool in pan 5 minutes, then pull rolls apart and cool on rack at least 15 minutes.",
            "A LITTLE AHEAD: Can be made 8 hours ahead. Cool rolls completely, then wrap in foil and let stand at room temperature. Rewarm foil-wrapped rolls in 350\u00b0F oven about 10 minutes, if desired, or serve at room temperature. FURTHER AHEAD: Can be made and then frozen up to 2 weeks ahead. Wrap in foil, then place in resealable plastic bag.",

            "*White whole wheat flour is milled from 100 percent hard white wheat. It contains all of the germ and bran (and nutritional value) of regular whole wheat, but has a naturally lighter color and milder flavor.
