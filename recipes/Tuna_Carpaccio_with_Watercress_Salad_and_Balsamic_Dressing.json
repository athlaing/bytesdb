Using flat side of mallet, gently pound tuna squares until they are very thin and form an 8- to 9-inch solid round. Place tuna round, still in plastic, on plate. Form 3 more rounds with remaining tuna. Refrigerate tuna carpaccio at least 30 minutes and up to 4 hours.",

Brush each with 1 tablespoon olive oil, then sprinkle with lemon juice, chives, shallot, sea salt, and pepper. Toss watercress and 2 tablespoons dressing in medium bowl; season to taste with sea salt and pepper. Mound watercress atop and serve."
