In cooled crust, alternate chocolate and coffee ice cream balls in single tightly packed layer. Form second layer, then third layer of ice cream balls, mounding in center.

Cover sauce and let stand at room temperature.) Gently press up pan bottom to loosen crust; remove pan sides. Transfer ice cream tart to platter. Let stand 15 minutes to soften slightly. Press cookies upright into ice cream, if desired. Cut tart into wedges. Serve, passing remaining sauce separately.",
