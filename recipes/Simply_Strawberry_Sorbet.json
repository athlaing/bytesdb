        "ingredients": [
            "3/4 cup sugar",
            "6 tablespoons water, preferably spring water",
            "1/4 teaspoon salt",
            "3 pints (about 1 1/2 pounds or 6 cups) fresh-picked strawberries, preferably organic, rinsed, patted dry, and hulled",
            "3 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice",
            "1 large egg white, preferably farm-fresh (optional)"

        "instructions": [
            "Make the simple syrup: In a saucepan over medium heat, combine the sugar, water, and salt. Cook, stirring, until the sugar and salt have dissolved, about 3 minutes. Let cool for 15 minutes.",
            "In a blender, pur\u00e9e the strawberries with the syrup and lemon juice until very smooth (you may need to divide this into several batches if your blender is not extra-large). If desired, strain through a fine-mesh sieve for a smoother texture. Cover and refrigerate until chilled, at least 4 hours or overnight.",
            "Churn in an ice cream maker according to the manufacturer's directions. Add the egg white, if using, during the last 2 to 3 minutes of churning. If making the ice cream cake , immediately pack into the pan. Or store, tightly covered, in the freezer.",
            "Variation: Strawberry-passion fruit sorbet: Cut 7 passion fruits in half and scoop the pulp and seeds into a blender. Blend for 20 seconds, then pass through a fine-mesh strainer into a small bowl, pushing on the solids with back of a wooden spoon. Measure out 6 tablespoons of this pur\u00e9e and combine with the strawberries, syrup, and lemon juice in a blender as directed above.",
