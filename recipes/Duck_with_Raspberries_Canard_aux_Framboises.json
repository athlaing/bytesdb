        "ingredients": [
            "4 pounds boneless magret duck breast halves with skin (about 4)",
            "1/2 cup finely chopped shallots",
            "2 garlic cloves, chopped",
            "2 tablespoons sugar",
            "1/3 cup raspberry vinegar",
            "1 cup demi-glace (6 1/2 ounces; preferably D'Artagnan duck and veal demi-glace)",
            "2 cups raspberries(12 ounces), divided",
            "1 1/2 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into bits"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Put a large shallow flameproof roasting pan in middle of oven and preheat to 400\u00b0F.",
            "Pat duck dry and trim off any excess fat. Score skin in a crosshatch pattern at 1/2-inch intervals with a sharp knife, then season with 1 tsp salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper (total). Roast, skin side down, in hot pan until an instant-read thermometer inserted diagonally into center registers 125\u00b0F, 20 to 25 minutes.",
            "Turn on broiler. Turn duck skin side up. Broil 4 to 6 inches from heat until golden brown, about 2 minutes. Transfer duck to a cutting board and let rest (skin side up) 10 minutes.",
            "While duck rests, pour off all but 1 tablespoon fat from pan, then add shallots and garlic and sau\u00e9 over medium-high heat until golden brown, about 2 minutes. Add sugar and cook, stirring, until dissolved. Stir in vinegar, scraping up brown bits. Add demi-glace and bring to a simmer. Stir in half of raspberries.",
            "Force sauce through a fine-mesh sieve into a small saucepan, discarding solids. Skim off excess fat. Over low heat, swirl in butter. Remove from heat and add remaining raspberries.",
            "Slice duck and serve with sauce."
