        "ingredients": [
            "2 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil",
            "2 garlic cloves, thinly sliced",
            "1 sprig rosemary (optional)",
            "1 (15-oz.) can chickpeas, rinsed",
            "1 Tbsp. tomato paste",
            "1 tsp. sweet smoked paprika",
            "1 cup heavy cream",
            "Kosher salt, freshly ground pepper",
            "2 large eggs",
            "4 thin slices of prosciutto",
            "Flaky sea salt (optional)",
            "Flatbread (for serving)"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Heat oil in a medium skillet over medium. Cook garlic and rosemary (if using), tossing, until garlic is golden brown and rosemary crisps up slightly but isn\u2019t browned, about 30 seconds for rosemary and 2 minutes for garlic. Transfer rosemary to a plate.",
            "Add chickpeas, tomato paste, and paprika to skillet and cook, stirring often, until coated, about 1 minute. Mix in cream, season with kosher salt and lots of pepper, and bring to a simmer.",
            "Crack eggs into chickpea mixture and season them with kosher salt. Cover (a baking sheet works great if you don\u2019t have a matching lid) and cook until white parts of eggs are set but yolks are still runny, about 2 minutes. Remove from heat and drape prosciutto around eggs. Crumble rosemary on top and sprinkle with sea salt, if desired, and more pepper. Serve with flatbread."
