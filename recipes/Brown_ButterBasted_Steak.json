        "ingredients": [
            "1 (1 3/4\"-thick) bone-in rib eye (about 1 1/2 lb.)",
            "Kosher salt, freshly ground pepper",
            "2 tsp. vegetable oil",
            "3 Tbsp. unsalted butter",
            "2 sprigs rosemary",
            "2 garlic cloves, crushed",
            "Flaky sea salt"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Season steak generously with kosher salt and pepper and let sit at room temperature 1 hour. Heat a dry large skillet, preferably cast iron, over medium-high, then add oil. As soon as oil is smoking, cook steak, turning every 2 minutes or so, until a deep brown crust forms and the internal temperature is a few degrees below your favored doneness (120\u00b0F\u2013125\u00b0F for medium-rare), 8\u201310 minutes. Add butter, rosemary, and garlic to skillet, tilt pan toward you so that butter pools on one side, and use a large spoon to continually baste steak with butter. Continue until butter is no longer bubbling and it smells nutty and is beginning to brown, about 1 minute. Transfer meat to a cutting board and let rest 10 minutes. (For medium-rare, your steak should reach an internal temperature of 125\u00b0F\u2013130\u00b0F.) Cut meat from bone and slice against the grain 1\" thick. Spoon some infused brown butter over steak and sprinkle with sea salt.",
