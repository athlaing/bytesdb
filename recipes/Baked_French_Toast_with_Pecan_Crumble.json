            "For french toast: Spread out bread on a rimmed baking sheet; let stand overnight. Butter a 13x9\" baking dish. Cut bread so slices are similar in size. Arrange, overlapping, in rows in prepared dish. Whisk eggs, egg yolks, cream, milk, sugar, vanilla, cinnamon, nutmeg, and salt in a medium bowl. Pour over bread, pressing bread to help it soak up custard. Cover and chill at least 2 hours.",
