            "3 firm apples (such as Granny Smith or Gala)",
            "1 tsp butter",
            "2 sheets parchment paper, 13\" x 18\" (found in the paper-goods aisle), or aluminum foil cut to size",
            "8 jumbo shrimp, peeled (leave tail) and deveined",
            "1 egg white",

        "instructions": [
            "Preheat oven to 350\u00b0F. Peel and core 2 apples. Wrap each in a sheet of aluminum foil and bake 35 minutes on a cookie sheet. Core third apple and cut into 8 slices. In a nonstick pan, saut\u00e9 slices in butter, 3 minutes per side. Remove pan from heat. Cut each parchment sheet into a heart, keeping shapes as large as possible (18-inch width). Brush one side of each heart with egg white. Unwrap baked apples, place in bowl and mash with a fork. Heat oven to 400\u00b0F. Spoon 1/2 cup mashed apples into a rectangle in the center of one half of each heart. Position 4 apple slices alternating with 4 shrimp atop mashed apples. Season with salt and pepper. Layer 2 Gruy\u00e8re slices on each arrangement. Fold heart, crimp edges to seal and bake 6 to 8 minutes on a cookie sheet. Transfer to plates and open right before serving."
