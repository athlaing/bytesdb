        "ingredients": [
            "3 3/4 cups all-purpose flour",
            "2 1/2 teaspoons instant or other active dry yeast",
            "2 1/2 teaspoon salt",
            "3/4 teaspoon sugar",
            "1 1/3 cups water, room temperature",
            "Olive oil, for greasing"

        "instructions": [
            "In a medium bowl, stir together the flour, yeast, salt, and sugar. Add the water, and using a wooden spoon or your hand, mix until blended, at least 30 seconds. The dough will be stiff, not wet and sticky. Cover the bowl and let it sit at room temperature until the dough has more than doubled in volume, about 2 hours. Divide the dough in two and shape each section into flattened balls. If you are only making one pizza, freeze the other ball in a freezer storage bag. If you rub a little olive oil on your fingers and on the ball of dough before bagging, it will be less sticky to negotiate.",
