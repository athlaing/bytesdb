        "instructions": [
            "Preheat the oven to 275\u00b0F. In a medium saucepan, heat the oil over medium heat. Add the leeks and onion, and saut\u00e9 for 7 to 10 minutes, or until soft.",

            "Place six standard-size flan dishes in a baking pan. Divide the custard mixture among the dishes. Pour warm water into the pan to come halfway up the sides of the dishes. Bake in the oven for 35 to 40 minutes, or until the center of each custard still jiggles slightly. Remove from the oven and lift the dishes from the hot water. Place the dishes on a baking sheet.",
            "Evenly sprinkle 4 teaspoons grated cheese or 1 1/2 teaspoons sugar over each custard. Using a hand-held blowtorch, brown the cheese or caramelize the sugar (see note below). Serve hot."
