        "ingredients": [
            "4 cups fresh strawberries (about 1 pound), hulled, halved*",
            "3/4 cup super fine sugar",
            "Peel (with white pith) of 1/2 lemon"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Combine all ingredients in a heavy, wide pot. Cover; let sit at room temperature, stirring occasionally, for 2 hours. (The berries will ooze and sugar will dissolve.) Bring strawberry mixture to a simmer over medium heat. Cook, stirring gently, until strawberries are just tender, about 3 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer strawberries to 1 pint jar. Continue simmering liquid until it thickens into a syrupy consistency, 1-2 minutes. Discard lemon peel and pour syrup over strawberries; seal and let cool to room temperature. Chill for up to 1 month.",
