            "1 pound dried cannellini (white kidney beans)",
            "8 cups room-temperature water",
            "2 tablespoons olive oil",
            "1 large head of garlic, unpeeled, top 1/2 inch cut off to expose cloves",
            "1 large fresh sage sprig",
            "1/4 teaspoon whole black peppercorns",
            "1 teaspoon coarse kosher salt",

            "Place beans in large bowl. Cover with cold water (at least 6 cups) and let soak overnight. Drain beans. Place in heavy large pot. Add 8 cups room-temperature water, 2 tablespoons olive oil, garlic, sage, and black peppercorns. Bring to simmer over medium-high heat. Reduce heat to mediumlow; simmer uncovered 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally. Mix in 1 teaspoon coarse salt. Continue to simmer until beans are tender, adding more water if needed to keep beans covered, about 30 minutes longer. Cool beans in liquid 1 hour. Using slotted spoon, transfer beans to serving bowl, reserving bean cooking liquid, if desired, but discarding garlic, sage, and peppercorns. Season beans to taste with pepper and more coarse salt. Drizzle with extra-virgin olive oil and serve.",
