        "instructions": [
            "Preheat oven to 350\u00b0F. Line an 8x8x2\" pan with parchment, leaving a 2\" overhang on 2 opposite sides. Whisk flour, 1/4 cup sugar, and salt in a medium bowl. Using your fingertips, rub butter into dry ingredients until mixture resembles coarse meal.",
            "Transfer to prepared pan; press evenly onto bottom of pan (using the bottom of a flat measuring cup works well). Prick dough all over with a fork.",
            "Bake shortbread until cooked through and pale golden, 25-30 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack. Let cool completely in pan. DO AHEAD: Shortbread can be made 3 days ahead. Cover pan tightly with plastic wrap and store at room temperature.",
            "Bring remaining 1/2 cup sugar, 1 1/2 cups cranberries, and grapefruit juice to a simmer in a small saucepan and cook, stirring occasionally, until cranberries burst and mixture is syrupy, about 8 minutes. Stir in remaining cranberries and cook until skins begin to split, about 3 minutes. Let cool. DO AHEAD: Cranberry topping can be made 3 days ahead. Cover and chill.",
            "Spread cooled cranberry topping over shortbread. Scatter zest over. Using paper overhang, lift shortbread from pan and transfer to a cutting board. Cut shortbread."
