            "Mix first 3 ingredients in processor. Add butter and cut in using on/off turns until mixture resembles coarse meal. Blend in yolk and vanilla using on/off turns. Blend in enough cream by teaspoonfuls to form dough that begins to clump together. Gather dough into ball; flatten into disk. Wrap in plastic and refrigerate 30 minutes. Preheat oven to 350\u00b0F. Roll out dough between sheets of waxed paper to 12-inch round. Transfer dough to 9-inch-diameter tart pan with removable bottom. Trim edges. Freeze crust 15 minutes. Line with foil. Fill with dried beans or pie weights. Bake until sides are set, about 10 minutes. Remove foil and beans; bake crust until golden, about 20 minutes more. Cool completely on rack.",
            "For fruit filling: Combine all ingredients in heavy medium saucepan and bring to boil. Reduce heat and simmer 1 minute. Pur\u00e9e mixture in processor to thick paste. Cool completely.",

            "For nut topping: Preheat oven to 400\u00b0F. Cook first 3 ingredients in heavy large saucepan over low heat, stirring until sugar dissolves. Increase heat and bring to boil. Boil vigorously 1 minute. Remove from heat. Add nuts and cream. Spread fruit filling in crust; smooth top. Set tart on cookie sheet. Spoon nut topping over. Bake until filling bubbles, about 20 minutes. Transfer tart to rack and cool 10 minutes. Using oven mitts, loosen tart pan sides but do not remove. Cool tart completely in pan. (Can be prepared 1 day ahead. Cover and let stand at room temperature.) Remove pan sides. Cut tart into wedges.",
