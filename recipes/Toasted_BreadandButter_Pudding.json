            "Preheat oven to 350\u00b0F. Butter both sides of bread slices and arrange in 1 layer on a large baking sheet. Bake in middle of oven, turning over once, until lightly toasted, 15 to 20 minutes. Transfer to a rack to cool. Whisk together half-and-half, eggs, sugar, vanilla, and salt until sugar is dissolved. Halve toasted bread slices diagonally and arrange triangles in rows, overlapping slightly, in a buttered 3-quart shallow baking dish. Pour custard evenly over toast and let stand 15 minutes. Bake pudding in a hot water bath until custard is set 2 to 3 inches from edges but still trembles in center, 50 to 60 minutes. (Custard will continue to set as it cools.) Serve warm.",
