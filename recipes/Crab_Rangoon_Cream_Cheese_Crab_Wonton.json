        "title": "Crab Rangoon (Cream Cheese Crab Wonton) ",
        "ingredients": [
            "8 oz (227 g) lump crab meat or snow crab",
            "16 oz (454 g) cream cheese, room temp",
            "2 green onions (whites only), very finely chopped",
            "2 tbsp (5 g) finely chopped tarragon",
            "Salt and pepper",
            "24 wonton skins (square)",
            "1 egg, slightly beaten, for sealing",
            "2 qt (1.9 L) vegetable oil for frying"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Press out as much liquid as possible from any crab meat you are using. Any excess moisture will soak through the wonton skins. In a medium bowl combine the crab, cream cheese, green onion, tarragon, salt and pepper either with your hands or a mixer with a paddle attachment.",
            "Take a wonton skin, place 1 teaspoon of filling in the center of each wrapper. With a finger dipped in egg, moisten the 2 adjacent sides; fold over the opposing corner to make a triangle. (You have some choices with shape. You can make a purse, tortellini or traditional triangle wontons.)",
            "Place the completed ones on a tray. Uncooked, rangoons can be wrapped and kept frozen for 1 to 2 weeks and dropped into the fryer frozen.",
            "Heat oil in a 4- or 5-quart (3.8- or 4.7-L) Dutch oven or pot until the oil reaches 360\u00b0F (182\u00b0C). Fry in small batches until golden about 2 minutes on each side and drain on a wire rack over a cookie sheet. I like to serve these with sweet chili or plum sauce."
