        "ingredients": [
            "3 cups chilled heavy cream",
            "1/2 cup plus 1 tablespoon sugar",
            "1 cup mascarpone cheese (about 9 oz) at room temperature",
            "1 (9-oz) box chocolate wafers such as Nabisco Famous",
            "1 tablespoon instant-espresso powder",
            "A 9 1/2- to 10-inch springform pan (about 26 cm)"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Beat 2 cups cream with 6 tablespoons sugar in a bowl with an electric mixer at medium speed until it just holds soft peaks, 2 to 4 minutes. Reduce speed to low, then add mascarpone and mix until combined.",
            "Spread 1 1/4 cups mascarpone mixture evenly in bottom of springform pan and cover with 14 wafers, slightly overlapping if necessary. Spread with another 1 1/4 cups mascarpone mixture, followed by 14 more wafers arranged in the same manner. Spread remaining mascarpone mixture on top. Smooth top with a metal offset spatula, then cover pan with foil and freeze until firm, about 1 hour. Transfer from freezer to refrigerator and chill, covered, until a sharp knife inserted into center cuts through softened wafers easily, about 8 hours.",
            "Pulse remaining chocolate wafers in a food processor until finely ground.",
            "Beat remaining cup cream with espresso powder and remaining 3 tablespoons sugar using electric mixer at medium speed until it just holds stiff peaks, about 3 minutes.",
            "Remove foil and side of pan and frost cake all over with espresso cream. Sprinkle edge of top lightly with wafer crumbs. Serve cold."
