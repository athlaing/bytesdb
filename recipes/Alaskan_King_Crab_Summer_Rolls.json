            "Peel daikon and cut into julienne (thin matchsticks). Transfer to a small bowl.",
            "Cut carrot into 2-inch lengths, then cut into julienne. Add to daikon and toss with lime juice, sesame oil, and salt to taste.",
            "Cut cucumber into julienne.",
            "Pur\u00e9e jalape\u00f1o and avocado with vinegar and 1/4 teaspoon salt in a blender, then transfer to a bowl and stir in mayonnaise and tobiko.",
            "Stir together yuzu juice, soy sauce, and chile oil in a small bowl.",
            "Soak 2 rice-paper wrappers in a 13-by 9-inch baking dish of warm water until pliable, about 5 seconds. Put 1 soaked wrapper on a damp kitchen towel (not terry cloth), then place other wrapper below the first (closer to you), overlapping them halfway. Put one fourth of crabmeat across lower third of wrapper (nearest you), leaving a 2-inch border at bottom. Spread with 1 1/2 tablespoons avocado mixture and top with one fourth each of carrot mixture, cucumber, and sliced scallion. Fold bottom of wrapper over filling and roll up tightly, putting 2 cilantro sprigs on wrapper halfway through. Make 3 more rolls in same manner (you will have avocado mixture left over).",
            "Trim ends and cut each roll into 4 pieces. Divide among 8 shallow bowls, standing them up, and top each with a dollop of avocado mixture and a cilantro leaf. Drizzle yuzu sauce around rolls."
