        "instructions": [
            "Cut white and pale-green parts of leeks crosswise into 1/2-inch-thick slices. In a bowl of cold water wash leeks well and lift from water into a colander to drain. Pat leeks dry. In a large skillet cook leeks in butter over moderate heat, stirring, until tender, about 12 minutes, and cool. Cut salmon into roughly 3/4-inch pieces and in a bowl toss with leeks, dill, zest, salt, and pepper until combined well.",
            "In a small bowl whisk together egg and water to make an egg wash. On a lightly floured surface with a lightly floured rolling pin roll 1 puff pastry sheet into a 10-inch square and the other into a 12-inch square. Transfer 10-inch pastry square to a floured large baking sheet and mound salmon filling in center, forming a round 8 inches in diameter. Brush edges of pastry evenly with some egg wash. Carefully drape remaining pastry square over salmon and gently press edges together to seal. With a sharp knife trim edges of pastry to form a 10-inch round. Crimp edges and cut 4 steam vents on top of crust. Brush crust evenly with some remaining egg wash. Chill pie, loosely covered, at least 1 hour and up to 3.",
            "Preheat oven to 400\u00b0F.",
            "Bake pie in middle of oven until pastry is golden brown, about 30 minutes.",
            "Serve pie warm or at room temperature with sauce."
