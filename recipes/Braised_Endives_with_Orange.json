            "1 orange",
            "5 Belgian endives (1 1/4 pounds)",
            "2/3 cup reduced-sodium chicken broth",
            "5 tablespoons unsalted butter, divided",
            "1 1/2 cups coarse fresh bread crumbs from a baguette",
            "1/2 teaspoon Chinese five-spice powder",
            "1/4 cup heavy cream"

        "instructions": [
            "Grate 1/2 teaspoon zest from orange, then squeeze juice. Set aside. Cut out a round of parchment paper to fit just inside a 12-inch heavy skillet and butter one side of parchment. Trim end of each endive and halve lengthwise. Arrange, cut sides down, in 1 layer in 12-inch skillet. Add broth, zest, 1/4 teaspoon salt, and 2 tablespoons butter, cut into bits. Cover endives with parchment, buttered side down. Simmer until tender and liquid is reduced to about 1/4 cup, 20 to 25 minutes. Preheat broiler. While endives braise, melt remaining 3 tablespoons butter. Stir together with bread crumbs, five-spice powder, and 1/4 teaspoon salt. Add cream to endives and cook, uncovered, over medium heat, swirling, until thickened, 1 to 3 minutes. Remove from heat and swirl in 1 tablespoon orange juice. Arrange endives cut sides up with sauce in a lightly buttered 1 1/2- to 2-quarts shallow baking dish. Sprinkle evenly with crumbs and broil 4 to 6 inches from heat until golden brown, about 2 minutes.",
