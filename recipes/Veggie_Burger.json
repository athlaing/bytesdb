            "1/3 cup white long-grain rice",
            "2 15-ounce cans black beans, rinsed",
            "1 medium shallot, chopped",
            "6 slices pickled jalape\u00f1o",
            "1 tablespoon prepared barbecue sauce",
            "1 teaspoon chili powder, preferably ancho",
            "1/2 teaspoon ground cumin",
            "1 large egg white",
            "Kosher salt, freshly ground pepper",
            "4 tablespoons vegetable oil, divided",
            "6 hamburger buns",

        "instructions": [
            "Cook rice according to package directions (you should have 1 cup cooked rice) and let cool.",
            "Set aside 1/2 cup beans. Pulse shallot, jalape\u00f1o, barbecue sauce, chili powder, cumin, and remaining beans in a food processor until a chunky pur\u00e9e forms.",
            "Transfer pur\u00e9e to a medium bowl and mix in egg white, rice, and reserved beans; season with salt and pepper. Form mixture into 6 patties about 1/2\" thick; cover and chill 1 hour (this helps bind patties so they stay intact while cooking).",
            "Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Working in two batches and adding remaining 2 tablespoons oil between batches, cook patties until browned and crisp, about 5 minutes per side. Serve on buns with desired toppings."
