            "Preheat oven to 300\u00b0F. Place salmon in a baking dish and rub with lemon zest, oregano, salt, and pepper on all sides, then coat with oil. Arrange peppers around salmon. Bake until salmon is firm but still pink in the center, about 20 minutes (if you prefer salmon more well done, cook an additional 5 minutes).",
            "Meanwhile, make the salad: Set a steamer basket in a large pot filled with 2\" water. Cover pot and bring water to a boil. Add potatoes, cover, and steam until tender, 10\u201312 minutes. Add asparagus to potatoes, cover, and steam until crisp-tender, 3\u20135 minutes. Meanwhile, whisk oil, lemon juice, honey, salt, pepper, and 1/4 cup dill in a small bowl or measuring cup. Toss escarole with half of the dressing in a large bowl, then transfer to a serving platter. Toss potatoes and asparagus with remaining dressing in same bowl, then arrange over escarole. Flake salmon into large pieces and arrange on platter. Top with feta, peppers, and dill sprigs.",
