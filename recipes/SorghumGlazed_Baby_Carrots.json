            "1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter",
            "2 pounds baby carrots or small carrots (such as Thumbelina), trimmed, peeled, halved lengthwise",
            "1 6\" piece of ginger, peeled, cut crosswise into 1/2\"-thick rounds",
            "1/2 cup sorghum syrup or honey",

            "Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add carrots and saut\u00e9 until beginning to soften, about 10 minutes. Add ginger and sorghum. Cook for 2 minutes. Remove from heat; stir in orange juice and bourbon. Return to heat; reduce heat to medium-low. Cover skillet and cook, stirring occasionally, until carrots are fork-tender, 5-7 minutes. Uncover and cook until liquid has been reduced to a syrupy consistency and carrots are nicely glazed, about 6 minutes. Discard ginger. Season to taste with salt and pepper."
