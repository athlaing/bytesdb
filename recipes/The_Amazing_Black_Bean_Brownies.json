        "ingredients": [
            "4 ounces unsweetened chocolate",
            "1 cup unsalted butter or non-hydrogenated butter substitute",
            "2 cups soft-cooked black beans, drained well",
            "1 cup walnuts, chopped",
            "1 tablespoon vanilla extract",
            "1/4 cup natural coffee substitute (or instant coffee, for gluten-sensitive)",
            "1/4 teaspoon sea salt",
            "4 large eggs",
            "1 1/2 cups light agave nectar"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Preheat the oven to 325\u00b0F. Line an 11- by 18-inch baking pan with parchment paper and lightly oil with canola oil spray.",
            "Melt the chocolate and butter in a glass bowl in the microwave for 1 1/2 to 2 minutes on high. Stir with a spoon to melt the chocolate completely. Place the beans, 1/2 cup of the walnuts, the vanilla extract, and a couple of spoonfuls of the melted chocolate mixture into the bowl of a food processor. Blend about 2 minutes, or until smooth. The batter should be thick and the beans smooth. Set aside.",
            "In a large bowl, mix together the remaining 1/2 cup walnuts, remaining melted chocolate mixture, coffee substitute, and salt. Mix well and set aside.",
            "In a separate bowl, with an electric mixer beat the eggs until light and creamy, about 1 minute. Add the agave nectar and beat well. Set aside.",
            "Add the bean/chocolate mixture to the coffee/chocolate mixture. Stir until blended well. Add the egg mixture, reserving about 1/2 cup. Mix well. Pour the batter into the prepared pan. Using an electric mixer, beat the remaining 1/2 cup egg mixture until light and fluffy. Drizzle over the brownie batter. Use a wooden toothpick to pull the egg mixture through the batter, creating a marbled effect. Bake for 30 to 40 minutes, until the brownies are set. Let cool in the pan completely before cutting into squares. (They will be soft until refrigerated.)"
