        "ingredients": [
            "1 3/4 cups warm water (105\u00b0F to 115\u00b0F)",
            "1 envelope dry yeast",
            "Pinch of sugar",
            "1 tablespoon salt",
            "1 tablespoon (generous) chopped fresh rosemary or 1 teaspoon dried",
            "4 cups (or more) bread flour",
            "2 tablespoons cold milk",
            "2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil",
            "Cornmeal",
            "12 fresh rosemary sprigs",
            "1 egg, beaten to blend (glaze)",
            "Coarse salt (optional)"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Place water in large bowl of electric mixer fitted with dough hook. Add yeast and pinch of sugar; stir to blend. Let stand until foamy, about 10 minutes. Add 1 tablespoon salt and chopped rosemary; beat at medium speed until blended. Add 4 cups flour, 1 cup at a time, beating until well incorporated. Mix milk and oil in small bowl. With mixer running on low speed, gradually add milk mixture. Increase speed to medium; beat 6 minutes. Scrape dough from hook and sides of bowl (dough will be soft and sticky). Let dough rest in bowl 15 minutes.",
            "Sprinkle 2 heavy large baking sheets generously with cornmeal. Turn out dough onto floured surface and knead until soft and slightly sticky, adding more flour if necessary. Divide dough into 12 equal pieces. Let dough rest 10 minutes.",
            "Roll each dough piece between work surface and palms of hands to 12-inch long rope. Arrange 6 ropes on each baking sheet, spacing apart. Break small green clusters off rosemary sprigs. Insert stem end of rosemary clusters along top of breadsticks, spacing rosemary 2 inches apart. Using sprayer filled with cold water, lightly mist breadsticks. Let rise uncovered in warm draft-free area until puffy and light, about 30 minutes.",
            "Position 1 rack in lowest third of oven and 1 rack in center and preheat to 450\u00b0F. Brush breadsticks lightly with glaze. Sprinkle very lightly with coarse salt, if desired. Place baking sheets on racks in oven and spray oven with water. Bake 15 minutes, spraying oven with water every 5 minutes, spraying oven with water every 5 minutes. Continue baking without spraying until breadsticks are golden and sound hollow when tapped, about 15 minutes longer. Transfer breadsticks to racks; cool. (Can be made ahead. Wrap tightly in foil and freeze up to 2 weeks. Thaw breadsticks. If desired, rewarm wrapped sticks in 350\u00b0F oven 15 minutes.)"
