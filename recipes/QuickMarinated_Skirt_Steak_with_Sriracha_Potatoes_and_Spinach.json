            "In a large bowl, toss potatoes with 1 tablespoon oil, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Spread in a single layer on pre-heated baking sheet, and roast until golden brown and tender, tossing halfway through, about 20 minutes.",
            "In a medium bowl, whisk together 2 tablespoons oil, 1/4 cup soy sauce, chile paste, and 1/4 teaspoon each salt and pepper. Add steaks, turning to coat them in the marinade, and let stand at room temperature for 5 minutes.",
            "Meanwhile, heat a large cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat. Add 2 tablespoons oil and let oil heat briefly. Working in batches if necessary, sear steaks until medium rare, 3 to 4 minutes per side. Remove steaks from skillet and transfer to a cutting board or plate to rest, reserving skillet.",
