        "title": "Stone Fruit Gazpacho with Scallops ",
        "ingredients": [
            "1 pound white peaches, pitted",
            "1 pound sour plums, pitted",
            "2 cups cubed yellow (or red) seedless watermelon",
            "1 clove garlic, coarsely chopped",
            "1 shallot, coarsely chopped",
            "1 tablespoon Champagne vinegar",
            "1 cup plus 3-4 tablespoons fruity olive oil",
            "Salt",
            "Freshly ground black pepper",
            "4 jumbo diver scallops",
            "Espelette pepper",
            "A few sprigs of fresh thyme (with blossoms if possible)"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Combine the peaches, plums, watermelon, garlic, shallots, and vinegar in the Vitamix, blender, or food processor. Process on high until smooth and creamy, then reduce the speed and drizzle in the 1 cup olive oil until completely incorporated. Season with salt and pepper and set aside to chill in the refrigerator. Go ahead and chill 4 glass soup bowls while you're at it. Preheat the oven to 325\u00b0. When the gazpacho is chilled, heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in an ovenproof skillet over medium-high heat. Season the scallops generously with salt and pepper. Once the olive oil slips easily across the pan, carefully place the scallops in the pan and sear until golden brown. I like the scallops to be just barely cooked, so I only sear one side. After about 2 minutes on the stovetop, put the whole kit and caboodle in the oven, without flipping the scallops; they will need 2-3 minutes in the oven. Fill each chilled soup bowl with a generous portion of gazpacho and nestle one scallop in each bowl, seared side up. A sprinkling of Espelette pepper and the thyme sprigs and blossoms and a drizzle of fruity olive oil is all you need.",
