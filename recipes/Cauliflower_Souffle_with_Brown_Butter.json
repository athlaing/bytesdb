            "Preheat oven to 400\u00b0F with rack in middle.",
            "Generously butter souffl\u00e9 dish, then sprinkle with cheese, knocking out excess.",
            "Stir together cauliflower, parsley, 1/4 teaspoon salt, and white pepper to taste in a large bowl.",
            "Melt butter in a 2- to 3-quart heavy saucepan over medium heat. Whisk in flour, then cook, whisking, until pale golden, about 2 minutes. Add milk a little at a time, whisking constantly until very smooth. Bring sauce to a boil, whisking, then simmer, whisking, until quite thick, about 1 minute. Remove from heat and whisk in yolks, 1/4 teaspoon white pepper, and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Stir into cauliflower mixture.",
            "Beat whites in a bowl with an electric mixer at high speed until they just hold stiff peaks (they should not look dry). Stir a heaping spoonful of whites into yolk mixture to lighten, then gently fold in remaining whites until just combined.",
            "Gently spoon into souffl\u00e9dish (leave at least 1 inches of space at top) and bake until golden brown and top appears set, 35 to 40 minutes.",
            "Make Brown Butter: Cook butter in a small heavy saucepan over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until it turns golden with a nutlike fragrance and flecks on bottom of pan turn a rich caramel brown, about 6 minutes. Remove from heat. Serve souffl\u00e9 immediately, drizzling with warm brown butter.",
