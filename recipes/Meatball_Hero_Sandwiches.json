Combine ground beef, grated Parmesan cheese, eggs, chopped fresh parsley, crushed cornflakes, minced garlic, dried oregano, ground white pepper and salt in large bowl and blend thoroughly. Using moistened hands, shape meat mixture into 1 1/2-inch rounds and place on prepared sheet, spacing evenly. Bake meatballs until just firm to touch and cooked through, about 20 minutes",
