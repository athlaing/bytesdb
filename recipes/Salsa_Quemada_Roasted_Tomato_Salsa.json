            "5 large Roma tomatoes, whole, not cored or cut in any way",
            "1 serrano or jalape\u00f1o chile",
            "2 cloves garlic, skin on",

        "instructions": [
            "1. Make sure your kitchen is well ventilated. Put a piece of aluminum foil in a heavy saut\u00e9 pan (preferably cast iron) and set it over medium-high heat. Place the whole tomatoes, chile, and garlic cloves in the pan and dry-roast them on all sides until well charred and soft. The garlic and chiles will be done quickly; the tomatoes may take 10 minutes or longer to cook.",
            "2. Peel the garlic and stem the chile. Place the tomatoes, garlic, and chile in a food processor with the onion, salt, and cilantro. Pulse until the salsa is smooth and taste for seasoning. The salsa will keep, refrigerated, for several days. Reseason before use."
