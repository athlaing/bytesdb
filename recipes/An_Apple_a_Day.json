            "For topping: Pulse almonds, flour, and powdered sugar in a food processor until almonds are finely ground. Whisk sugar and ginger in a large bowl. Using an electric mixer, add egg whites one at a time to sugar mixture, beating to blend between additions. With mixer running, gradually beat in hot melted butter. Fold in almond mixture (topping will be thin). DO AHEAD: Topping can be made 1 hour ahead. Let stand at room temperature. Preheat oven to 350\u00b0F. Pour topping over filling in ramekins, dividing equally. Place ramekins on a rimmed baking sheet. Bake until topping is puffed and tops of cakes are golden brown, 25-30 minutes. Let cool for at least 15 minutes. Serve warm, topped with a small scoop of ice cream.",
