            "Vegetable oil (for grill)",
            "1/2 cup pineapple juice (from a can)",
            "1/4 cup honey",
            "1/4 cup unseasoned rice vinegar",
            "3 Tbsp. Dijon mustard",
            "1 tsp. crushed red pepper flakes",
            "1/2 tsp. toasted sesame oil",
            "1/2 tsp. ground turmeric",
            "4 (1\"-thick) bone-in pork chops",
            "Kosher salt"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Prepare a grill for high indirect heat (for a gas grill, leave one or two burners off; for a charcoal grill, bank coals on one side); oil grate. Bring pineapple juice, honey, vinegar, mustard, red pepper flakes, sesame oil, and turmeric to a simmer in a small saucepan over medium heat and cook, swirling occasionally, until reduced to 3/4 cup, 10\u201315 minutes. Let cool. Transfer half of sauce to a small bowl and set aside for serving.",
            "Season pork with salt. Grill over direct heat until browned all over, about 3 minutes per side. Continue to grill, turning several times and basting with remaining sauce, until charred and coated with a thick layer of glaze, about 4 minutes. Move to cooler part of grill and take internal temperature of pork. If needed, continue grilling over indirect heat until an instant-read thermometer inserted into chops near bone registers 130\u00b0F, 1\u20134 minutes more. Transfer pork chops to a wire rack and let rest 10 minutes before slicing. Serve with reserved sauce alongside."
