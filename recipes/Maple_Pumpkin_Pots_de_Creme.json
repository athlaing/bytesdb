            "3/4 cup pure maple syrup",
            "1/2 cup canned solid-pack pumpkin",
            "7 large egg yolks",
            "1/2 teaspoon cinnamon",
            "1/8 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg",

            "Preheat oven to 325\u00b0F. Whisk together cream, milk, syrup, and pumpkin in a heavy saucepan and bring just to a simmer over moderate heat. Whisk together yolks, cinnamon, nutmeg, and salt in a bowl. Add hot pumpkin mixture to yolks in a slow stream, whisking constantly. Pour custard through a fine-mesh sieve into a large measuring cup, then divide among custard cups (you may have some custard left over, depending on size of cups). Bake custards in a hot water bath, pan covered tightly with foil, in middle of oven until a knife inserted in center of a custard comes out clean, 35 to 40 minutes. Transfer custards to a rack to cool completely. Chill, covered, until cold, at least 2 hours.",
