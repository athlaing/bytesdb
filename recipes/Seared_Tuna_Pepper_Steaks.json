        "ingredients": [
            "4 6- to 7-ounce ahi tuna steaks (each about 1 inch thick)",
            "1 tablespoon coarsely cracked black pepper",
            "2 teaspoons oriental sesame oil",
            "2 tablespoons soy sauce",
            "1/4 cup dry Sherry",
            "2 tablespoons chopped fresh chives or green onion tops"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Sprinkle tuna steaks on both sides with salt, then sprinkle with coarsely cracked black pepper, pressing gently to adhere. Heat sesame oil in large nonstick skillet over high heat. Add tuna steaks and sear until brown outside and just opaque in center, about 3 minutes per side. Using tongs, transfer tuna steaks to platter. Tent platter loosely with foil to keep tuna steaks warm. Add soy sauce, then Sherry to same skillet. Reduce heat and simmer until mixture is slightly reduced, scraping up any browned bits, about 1 minute. Spoon sauce over tuna steaks. Sprinkle with chives or green onion tops."
