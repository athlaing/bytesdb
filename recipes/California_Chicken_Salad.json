Heat skillet over high heat and add oil. When oil is hot, add chicken. Reduce heat to medium-high and cook for 6 minutes per side, turning halfway through. Reduce heat to low and cover. Cook until chicken is no longer pink inside, 2 to 3 minutes. Cool chicken and slice thinly. Boil corn in a medium saucepan 5 minutes; cool, then cut kernels off cob; place in a bowl. Steam asparagus in 1 inch boiling water 3 minutes; drain and cool 1 minute. Add to bowl along with remaining vegetables. Heat a dry pan over medium heat. Add pine nuts. Cook, stirring often, until toasted, about 6 minutes. Place salad on a platter; top with chicken, bacon, pine nuts and dressing."
