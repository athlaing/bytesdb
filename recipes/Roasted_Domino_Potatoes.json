        "ingredients": [
            "6 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted, divided",
            "3 1/2 pounds Idaho potatoes (4-6 large)",
            "24 (about) fresh or dried bay leaves",
            "Kosher salt and fleur de sel"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Preheat oven to 425\u00b0F. Brush a 13x9x2\" baking dish or cast-iron griddle with 2 tablespoons butter. Peel potatoes and trim ends (do not rinse). Trim all 4 sides of potatoes to form a rectangle. Using a mandoline, cut potatoes crosswise into 1/8\" slices, keeping slices in stacks as best you can.",
            "Re-form slices from each potato into a stack. Place in prepared dish, fanning apart slightly like a deck of cards. Insert bay leaves between potato slices at even intervals. Season with salt and drizzle with remaining 4 tablespoons butter.",
            "Bake potatoes, rotating the dish halfway through cooking, until the edges are crisp and golden and the centers are tender, about 1 hour. Sprinkle with fleur de sel."
