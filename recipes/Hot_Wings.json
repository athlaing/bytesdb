        "ingredients": [
            "2 tablespoons Scotch Bonnet Hot Sauce",
            "1 tablespoon unsalted butter, at room temperature",
            "Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper",
            "6 whole chicken wings, wings and drumettes separated, wing tips removed",
            "1 tablespoon cornstarch",
            "Grapeseed or other neutral oil",
            "1/2 jalape\u00f1o, very thinly sliced crosswise"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "In a small saucepan, heat the sauce over medium heat until hot. Whisk in the butter, a little at a time. Continue whisking until the mixture is emulsified. Whisk in salt to taste, then reduce the heat to low to keep the sauce warm.",
            "Sprinkle salt and pepper all over the chicken and let stand for 5 minutes to release the moisture on the skin. Sprinkle the cornstarch all over the chicken and toss until evenly coated.",
            "Fill a large skillet with oil to a depth of 1/2 inch. Heat over high heat until hot and shimmering. (When the oil is ready, a cube of bread dropped into it will turn golden in 15 seconds.)",
            "Reduce the heat to medium and add the drumettes first, then the wings in a single layer. Cook, turning the chicken with tongs, for 4 minutes. Raise the heat to high. Cook, turning occasionally, until the chicken is golden brown outside and no longer pink inside, about 4 minutes longer.",
            "Transfer the chicken to a large bowl and add the hot sauce and jalape\u00f1o. Toss until evenly coated. Serve immediately."
