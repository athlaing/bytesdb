        "ingredients": [
            "1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour",
            "1/4 teaspoon baking soda",
            "1/4 teaspoon salt",
            "1 stick unsalted butter, softened",
            "1 cup packed light brown sugar",
            "1 large egg",
            "1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract",
            "1/2 cup whole blanched almonds (2 1/2 ounces)"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Whisk together flour, baking soda, and salt. Beat together butter and brown sugar in a large bowl with an electric mixer until pale and fluffy, then beat in egg and vanilla. At low speed, mix in flour mixture until a dough just forms. Stir in whole almonds. Divide dough in half. Using a sheet of plastic wrap or wax paper as an aid, form each piece of dough into a log 9 to 9 1/2 inches long (about 1 1/4 inches in diameter). Chill, wrapped in plastic wrap, until very firm, at least 4 hours. Freeze 30 minutes to facilitate slicing.",
            "Preheat oven to 350\u00b0F with racks in upper and lower thirds. Line 2 large baking sheets with parchment paper. Cut 1 log of dough crosswise into slices less than 1/8 inch thick with a thin sharp knife, rotating log after each slice to help keep round shape. (If dough gets too soft to slice through nuts easily, freeze briefly.) Arrange cookies about 1/2 inch apart on baking sheets.",
            "Bake cookies, switching position of sheets halfway through, until golden brown all over, 12 to 15 minutes total. Transfer cookies on parchment to racks to cool.",
            "Repeat with remaining dough (cool baking sheets and line with fresh parchment)."
