        "ingredients": [
            "1/2 cup whole milk",
            "2 tablespoons sugar",
            "1 1/4-ounce envelope active dry yeast (about 2 1/4 teaspoon)",
            "1/2 cup buttermilk",
            "1/2 small onion, finely chopped",
            "2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh dill",
            "2 teaspoons dill seeds",
            "1 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt",
            "2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour plus more",
            "4 tablespoons (1/2 stick) unsalted butter, melted, divided, plus more for bowl and parchment paper"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Gently heat milk until warm to the touch (an instant-read thermometer should register 120\u00b0F\u2013130\u00b0F). Add sugar and yeast and whisk to combine. Add buttermilk; let sit until yeast starts to foam, 5\u201310 minutes. Combine onion, fresh dill, dill seeds, salt, and 2 1/2 cups flour in a large bowl. Stir in milk mixture and 2 tablespoons butter, adding more flour as needed (dough will initially be fairly wet), until a sticky dough forms. Turn out onto a lightly floured surface and knead until dough is smooth and elastic, about 5 minutes. Transfer dough to a lightly buttered bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Let rise in a warm, draft-free area until doubled in size, about 1 hour. Punch down dough and let rise until doubled again, about 1 hour. Punch down dough and, using a pastry scraper or a sharp knife, divide into 12 pieces. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and lightly butter top. Cupping your hand over and using your palm, roll each piece of dough on work surface into a ball and place on prepared baking sheet, spacing at least 2\" apart (you need to leave enough room so that they're not touching after they've risen). Brush tops with remaining 2 tablespoons butter and cover loosely with plastic wrap; let rise until almost doubled in size, 20\u201330 minutes. Meanwhile, preheat oven to 400\u00b0F. Bake rolls until puffed and deep golden brown on the tops and bottoms, 15\u201320 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack and let cool slightly before serving. DO AHEAD: Rolls can be made 3 hours ahead. Reheat before serving, if desired.",
