        "ingredients": [
            "5 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil",
            "1 garlic clove, peeled",
            "1 pound medium zucchini, trimmed, cut into 1/4-inch-thick rounds (about 3 1/2 cups)",
            "2 large eggs, room temperature",
            "3/4 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese (about 2 1/2 ounces)",
            "12 ounces spaghetti",
            "6 large fresh basil leaves, torn into pieces, divided"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Heat oil in heavy large skillet over medium heat. Add garlic and saut\u00e9 until pale golden, about 1 minute. Add zucchini and saut\u00e9 until beginning to color, about 15 minutes. Remove from heat; discard garlic. Meanwhile, whisk eggs and Parmesan in large bowl to blend. Cook pasta in large pot of boiling salted water until just tender but still firm to bite, stirring occasionally. Drain pasta; add to egg mixture and toss to coat (heat from pasta will cook eggs). Add zucchini mixture and half of basil to pasta; stir gently to blend. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Sprinkle with remaining basil and serve.",
