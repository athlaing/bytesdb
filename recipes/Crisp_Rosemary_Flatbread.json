        "title": "Crisp Rosemary Flatbread ",
        "ingredients": [
            "1 3/4 cups unbleached all-purpose flour",
            "1 tablespoon chopped rosemary plus 2 (6-inch) sprigs",
            "1 teaspoon baking powder",
            "3/4 teaspoon salt",
            "1/2 cup water",
            "1/3 cup olive oil plus more for brushing",
            "Flaky sea salt such as Maldon"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Preheat oven to 450\u00b0F with a heavy baking sheet on rack in middle. Stir together flour, chopped rosemary, baking powder, and salt in a medium bowl. Make a well in center, then add water and oil and gradually stir into flour with a wooden spoon until a dough forms. Knead dough gently on a work surface 4 or 5 times. Divide dough into 3 pieces and roll out 1 piece (keep remaining pieces covered with plastic wrap) on a sheet of parchment paper into a 10-inch round (shape can be rustic; dough should be thin). Lightly brush top with additional oil and scatter small clusters of rosemary leaves on top, pressing in slightly. Sprinkle with sea salt. Slide round (still on parchment) onto preheated baking sheet and bake until pale golden and browned in spots, 8 to 10 minutes. Transfer flatbread (discard parchment) to a rack to cool, then make 2 more rounds (1 at a time) on fresh parchment (do not oil or salt until just before baking). Break into pieces.",
