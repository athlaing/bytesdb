            "Cook the bluefish: Preheat oven to 350\u00b0F. Season the bluefish with 1/2 teaspoon each salt and pepper. In a large, oven-safe skillet over medium-high heat, warm 2 tablespoons canola oil until hot and shimmering. Place the bluefish fillets skin side down in oil and do not move once in skillet. Allow the skin to become crispy, this should take about 90 seconds. Without moving the fillets, place the pan in the preheated oven for 5 to 7 minutes, until cooked through. Remove the skillet from the oven and drop the butter into the pan. As the butter begins to melt, baste the bluefish fillets. Remove from fillets from pan and set aside.",

            "Make the charred corn: Preheat a grill or grill pan over high heat. Brush the corn with 1 tablespoon canola oil and season with 1/2 teaspoon each salt and pepper. Grill corn, giving a quarter turn about every 20 seconds, allowing the kernels to become slightly charred. Once charred, remove from heat. When cool enough to handle, slice the kernels off the cob. In a medium pan over medium-high heat, warm the remaining 1 tablespoon canola oil. Add the leek and garlic to the pan, cook until the leek begins to become transparent, about 45 seconds. Add the corn to the pan and heat through. Remove from heat and season with 1/4 teaspoon salt and 1/8 teaspoon pepper.",
