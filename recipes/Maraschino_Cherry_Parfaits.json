            "Make the Maraschino cherries: Set a mesh sieve over a medium bowl. Bring cherries, sugar, lemon juice, and 2/3 cup water to a simmer in a large saucepan over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally; cook until cherries have released their juices and are softened but still intact, 20\u201325 minutes. Pour cherries into prepared sieve, letting juices collect in bowl. Set cherries aside. Return juices to same saucepan and bring to a simmer over medium heat. Cook until liquid is reduced to 1 1/2 cups (it will be a thin syrup at this point), 15\u201320 minutes. Remove from heat, add reserved cherries, and stir in liqueur and almond extract. Transfer maraschino cherries to jar, cover, and chill at least 24 hours before using.",
