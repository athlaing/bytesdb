            "1 1/4 cups buttermilk",
            "2/3 cup quick-cooking rolled oats (not instant)",
            "1 large egg, beaten lightly",
            "2 tablespoons firmly packed light brown sugar",
            "2/3 cup firmly packed grated peeled Granny Smith apple, excess juice squeezed out",
            "6 tablespoons all-purpose flour",
            "6 tablespoons whole-wheat flour",
            "1 teaspoon baking soda",
            "1/2 teaspoon salt",
            "1 teaspoon cinnamon",
            "2 tablespoons vegetable oil plus additional for brushing the griddle",
            "maple syrup as an accompaniment"

        "instructions": [
            "In a bowl whisk together 1 cup of the buttermilk and the oats and let the mixture stand for 15 minutes. In a large bowl whisk together the egg, the brown sugar, and the apple. Stir in the flours, the baking soda, the salt, the cinnamon, 2 tablespoons of the oil, the oats mixture, and the remaining 1/4 cup buttermilk and combine the batter well. Heat a griddle over moderate heat until it is hot enough to make drops of water scatter over its surface, brush it with the additional oil, and drop the batter by half-filled 1/4-cup measures onto it. Cook the pancakes for 1 to 2 minutes on each side, or until they are golden and cooked through. Serve the pancakes with syrup."
