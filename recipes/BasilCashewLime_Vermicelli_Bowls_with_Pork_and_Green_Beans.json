            "1 cup salted, roasted cashews, divided",
            "1 tsp. ground turmeric",
            "1 tsp. freshly ground black pepper",
            "1 3/4 tsp. kosher salt, plus more",
            "2 1/2 tsp. light brown sugar, divided",
            "2 large boneless center-cut pork loin chops (about 1 1/4 lb. total)",
            "8 oz. vermicelli rice noodles",
            "2 cups basil leaves",
            "2 small serrano chiles, seeds removed",
            "1 Tbsp. finely grated lime zest",
            "1/3 cup fresh lime juice",
            "1 Tbsp. vegetable oil",
            "1 lb. green beans, trimmed, halved crosswise",
            "1 cup mint leaves",

        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Place 3/4 cup cashews in a blender and cover with 3/4 cup boiling water. Let soak 10 minutes.",
            "Meanwhile, mix turmeric, pepper, 1 tsp. salt, and 1 tsp. brown sugar in a small bowl; set aside.",
            "Working one at a time, place pork chop flat on a work surface. First, butterfly the pork chop so that it\u2019s thinner, which will reduce cooking time and create more surface area for seasoning. Using a sharp knife and starting from an outside edge, slice three-quarters of the way through the center of chop, as though you\u2019re slicing a bagel in half, then open it up like a book. Place butterflied chop between 2 sheets of plastic wrap or inside a heavy-duty resealable plastic bag and pound to 1/4\" thin. Repeat with remaining chop. Rub chops with turmeric mixture and let sit 10 minutes.",
            "Cook vermicelli according to package directions. Run under cold water to stop the cooking, then transfer to a large bowl.",
            "Add basil, chiles, lime zest and juice, and remaining 1 1/2 tsp. brown sugar and 3/4 tsp. salt to cashews and cashew soaking water in blender and pur\u00e9e until smooth and creamy. Pour sauce over noodles and toss to combine.",
            "Heat oil in a large heavy skillet over high until shimmering. Cook cutlets one at a time until browned and cooked through, about 2 minutes per side. Transfer to a cutting board and let rest 5 minutes. Slice into 1/2\"-thick strips.",
            "While pork rests, cook green beans in same skillet over high heat, stirring often, until lightly charred and crisp-tender, about 5 minutes.",
            "Divide noodle mixture among bowls. Arrange pork and green beans over. Top with mint and remaining 1/4 cup cashews. Serve with lime wedges alongside."
