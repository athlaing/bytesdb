Remove from heat. On a work surface lay 1 sheet of phyllo at a time with the narrow end toward you. Lightly spray or brush the sheet with oil. Fold sheet into thirds, lengthwise. Spray again with oil. Spoon 3 tbsp filling onto phyllo strip, about 1 1/2 inches from the bottom and slightly to the left. Fold up a 1 1/2-inch flap to cover filling. Fold lower left corner of phyllo diagonally to the right side of dough to cover filling. Continue folding flag-style until you reach the end of the sheet. Repeat with remaining phyllo sheets and filling. Place turnovers onto a baking sheet lightly coated with oil. Bake 15 minutes or until golden brown. Serve warm.",
