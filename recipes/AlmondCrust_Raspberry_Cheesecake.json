In a food processor, pulse almonds until very finely ground. Add brown sugar,butter and a pinch of salt; pulse briefly to combine. Transfer to prepared pan and press firmly into bottom to form an even crust. Add cream cheese, granulated sugar, sour cream and vanilla to food processor; puree until smooth. Add eggs 1 at a time, blending after each addition. Pour filling onto crust. Spoon raspberry sauce on top and swirl using the tip of a knife, wiping it clean occasionally. Place springform pan in a 9\" x 13\" baking pan. Add warm water to come 1 inch up side of springform pan. Bake until cheesecake center jiggles slightly, 50 to 60 minutes. Let stand at room temperature until cool enough to touch. Remove springform pan from water, cover cake with foil and refrigerate at least 4 hours or overnight. Run a table knife between edge of cheesecake and springform pan before gently removing side of pan.",
