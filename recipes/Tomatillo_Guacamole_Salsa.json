        "ingredients": [
            "3/4 pound fresh tomatillos (available at specialty produce markets and some supermarkets), husked and rinsed",
            "1/4 to 1/3 cup packed fresh coriander",
            "1 garlic clove",
            "3 avocados (preferably California)"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "In a saucepan simmer the fresh tomatillos in salted boiling water to cover for 8 to 10 minutes, or until they are tender, transfer them with a slotted spoon to a bowl, and let them cool. (Alternatively, use a drained 11-ounce can tomatillos, see note above.) In a food processor or blender pur\u00e9e the tomatillos with the coriander to taste, the garlic, and salt to taste and transfer the mixture to a bowl. Halve and pit the avocados, chop the flesh, and stir it into the tomatillo mixture. Serve the salsa with tortilla chips or with hamburgers, grilled meat, or fish."
