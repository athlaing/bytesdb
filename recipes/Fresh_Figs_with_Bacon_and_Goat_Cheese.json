        "title": "Fresh Figs with Bacon and Goat Cheese ",
        "ingredients": [
            "4 to 6 regular smoked bacon slices (2 1/4 to 3 1/2 ounces uncooked)",
            "12 small fresh ripe figs, such as white or Calimyrna, halved lengthwise",
            "About 1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar",
            "1/3 cup (about 1 1/2 ounces) crumbled mild herbed goat cheese"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Preheat the oven to 350\u00b0 F. In a medium heavy skillet, place the bacon slices in a single layer and cook over low to medium-low heat, turning as needed until just beginning to brown. Transfer to a paper towel to drain. Cut each bacon slice into 4 or 6 pieces.",
            "Arrange the figs on a baking sheet, cut sides up. Brush the cut surfaces with balsamic vinegar. Place a piece of bacon on each cut side. Top with a small crumble of cheese. Bake until the figs are warmed, about 8 minutes. The cheese will not melt but may toast a bit. Serve immediately."
