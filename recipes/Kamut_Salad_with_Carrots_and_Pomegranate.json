            "1 cup water",
            "1/2 cup Kamut berries, soaked overnight and drained",
            "2 1/2 cups shredded carrots (about 3 medium)",
            "1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons golden raisins",
            "3 tablespoons freshly squeezed orange juice",
            "1 tablespoon freshly squeezed lemon juice",
            "1 teaspoon honey",
            "1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon",
            "1/4 teaspoon fine sea salt",

        ],
        "instructions": [
            "1 To prepare the Kamut, bring the water and the Kamut berries to a boil in a small heavy-bottomed saucepan. Decrease the heat to maintain a simmer, cover, and cook until the Kamut berries are tender but still slightly chewy, 50 to 60 minutes. Remove from the heat and, if you have time, let it sit, covered, for 10 to 15 minutes. Drain any remaining liquid and transfer to a large serving bowl to cool.",
            "2 Once the Kamut has cooled, make the salad. Add the carrots and golden raisins to the serving bowl. In a small bowl, whisk together the orange and lemon juices, honey, cinnamon, and salt until smooth. Gradually whisk in the olive oil in a thin stream.",
            "3 To finish, pour the dressing over the salad and toss to combine. Taste and adjust for salt. Let sit at room temperature for 15 minutes to allow the flavors to come together. Toss again before serving; sprinkle with the walnuts and garnish with the pomegranate seeds."
