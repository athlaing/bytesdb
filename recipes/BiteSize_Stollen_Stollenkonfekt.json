            "Preheat the oven to 350\u00b0F/180\u00b0C. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper. To make the dough: Place the butter and sugar in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment and cream together until fluffy. Add the Quark, grated lemon peel, vanilla extract, and rum; beat until well combined. In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour, salt, cinnamon, cloves, cardamom, and baking powder. Add to the Quark mixture and beat together until just combined. Briefly beat in the almonds and raisins. Using your hands, pinch off golf ball\u2013size pieces of dough and, without overhandling them, form them into 2-inch/5cm ovals or blocks. Place them on the prepared baking sheets, leaving 1 inch/2.5 cm between them. Place one baking sheet in the oven and bake for 30 minutes, or until the Stollen bites are a pale golden brown.Meanwhile, make the topping: Melt the butter in a small saucepan. Place the confectioners\u2019 sugar and Vanilla Sugar in a small bowl and whisk to combine.Remove the Stollen bites from the oven and slide in the second batch. Let the finished bites cool briefly, just until you can handle them. Dip each bite into the melted butter, and then toss in the confectioners\u2019 sugar mixture and place back on the baking sheet to set. Repeat with the second batch when they have baked.When the Stollen bites are completely cool, store in airtight containers, separated by pieces of waxed or parchment paper, for at least 1 day. They are best if allowed to rest for 3 to 4 days before serving. Just before serving, dust the bites again with a fresh layer of sifted confectioners\u2019 sugar. The bites will keep in an airtight container for at least 10 days and up to 3 weeks.",
