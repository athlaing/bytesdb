        "ingredients": [
            "1 tablespoon Chinkiang vinegar",
            "1 teaspoon Sichuan chili oil",
            "1 teaspoon sesame oil",
            "1 teaspoon turbinado sugar",
            "1/4 teaspoon Kosher salt",
            "3 Persian or Kirby cucumbers or 1 English cucumber",
            "1 teaspoon toasted sesame seeds",
            "2 tablespoons roasted unsalted peanuts, crushed",

        "instructions": [
            "Whisk together the vinegar, chili oil, sesame oil, sugar, and salt in a medium bowl until the sugar dissolves. Set the dressing aside.",
            "Halve the cucumbers lengthwise. (If using English cucumbers, remove the seeds with a small spoon and discard.) Set them cut-side down on a cutting board and lightly smash them: Give them a couple angry thwaps with the side of a cleaver (or a large chef\u2019s knife) until the cucumbers crack in a few places. (For less drama, just press down on them with the side of the knife.) Cut the abused cucumbers crosswise into 3/4-inch-thick half-moons.",
            "Toss the cucumbers in the dressing, portion them out onto plates, and top each serving with sesame seeds, peanuts, and cilantro."
