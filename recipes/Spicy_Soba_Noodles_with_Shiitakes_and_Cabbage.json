            "1/3 cup soy sauce",
            "2 to 3 teaspoons Korean hot-pepper paste (sometimes labeled \"gochujang\")",
            "1 tablespoon packed brown sugar",
            "3 tablespoons sesame seeds",
            "1/4 cup vegetable oil",
            "2 tablespoons finely chopped peeled ginger",
            "1 tablespoon finely chopped garlic",
            "10 oz fresh shiitake mushrooms, stemmed and thinly sliced",
            "1 1/4 pound Napa cabbage, thinly sliced (8 cups)",
            "6 scallions, thinly sliced",
            "8 to 9 ounces soba (buckwheat noodles)",
            "1 cup frozen shelled edamame"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Stir together all sauce ingredients until brown sugar is dissolved, then set aside.",
            "Toast sesame seeds in a dry 12-inch heavy skillet (not nonstick) over medium heat, stirring, until pale golden, then transfer to a small bowl.",
            "Heat oil in skillet over medium-high heat until it shimmers, then saut\u00e9 ginger and garlic, stirring, until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add shiitakes and saut\u00e9, stirring frequently, until tender and starting to brown, about 6 minutes. Reduce heat to medium, then add cabbage and most of scallions (reserve about a tablespoon for garnish) and cook, stirring occasionally, until cabbage is crisp-tender, about 6 minutes. Add sauce and simmer 2 minutes.",
            "While cabbage is cooking, cook soba and edamame together in a pasta pot of boiling salted water (2 tablespoons salt for 6 quarts water) until noodles are just tender, about 6 minutes. Drain in a colander and rinse under cool water to stop cooking and remove excess starch, then drain well again. Transfer to a large bowl and toss with sesame seeds and vegetable mixture. Serve sprinkled with reserved scallions."
