            "1 1/2 pounds plums, halved, pitted, sliced 1/4 inch thick",
            "1/2 cup sugar",
            "1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice",
            "1/2 teaspoon ground cardamom",
            "4 large egg whites",
            "1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar",
            "1 cup sugar",
            "2 teaspoons cornstarch",
            "1/2 teaspoon apple cider vinegar",
            "1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract",
            "1/4 teaspoon ground cardamom",

        "instructions": [
            "Combine all ingredients in large skillet; toss to coat. Cover and cook over medium-high heat until sugar dissolves, stirring occasionally, about 5 minutes. Uncover and cook until plums are tender but still hold shape, stirring occasionally, about 3 minutes longer; cool to room temperature. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Transfer to bowl. Cover and chill.)",
            "For meringues: Preheat oven to 350\u00b0F. Line large baking sheet with parchment paper. Using electric mixer, beat egg whites in large bowl 1 minute. Add cream of tartar. Continue to beat until soft peaks form. Gradually add sugar, beating until whites are thick and resemble marshmallow creme, about 5 minutes. Beat in cornstarch, vinegar, vanilla, and cardamom. Drop meringue onto prepared sheet in 6 mounds, spaced 3 inches apart. Using back of spoon, make depression in center of each. Place meringues in oven. Immediately reduce temperature to 250\u00b0F. Bake until meringues are dry outside (but centers remain soft) and pale straw color and lift easily from parchment, about 50 minutes. Cool on sheet on rack. (Can be made 8 hours ahead. Let stand at room temperature.)",
