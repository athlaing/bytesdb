            "Make the apple filling: Position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 375\u00b0F. Peel the apples and cut them in half lengthwise. Scoop out the cores and discard. Cut the apple halves lengthwise into 1/2- to 3/4-inch-thick slices\u2014there should be about 6 cups total. Transfer the apple slices to an ungreased 8-inch-square baking dish and spread them out evenly. Drizzle up to 1/4 cup of water over the apples\u2014use less water if the apples are particularly juicy. Scatter the crisp topping evenly over the fruit without pressing down on it. Bake until the topping is browned, the apples are tender when pierced with a knife, and the juices are bubbling, about 45 to 50 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack to cool for 10 minutes. Serve warm, with or without a scoop of vanilla ice cream or a drizzle of heavy cream. DO AHEAD: Apple crisp can be baked, cooled completely, covered, and kept at room temperature for 1 day. Reheat, uncovered, in a warm oven until heated through.",
