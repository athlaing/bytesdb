            "Line small baking sheet with foil. Stir chocolate in top of double boiler over barely simmering water until melted and smooth. Remove from over water. Using pastry brush, carefully coat heavily veined sides of camellia leaves with melted chocolate. Using fingertips, wipe away any chocolate overflow from edges. Place leaves on prepared baking sheet. Freeze leaves just until firm, about 10 minutes.",
            "Carefully peel camellia leaves from chocolate leaves. Return chocolate leaves to baking sheet; freeze at least 10 minutes. Dip artist's brush into gold dust; brush generously over some leaves. Cover and freeze. (Can be prepared 3 days ahead.) Arrange leaves decoratively on cake and serve."
