            "1 1/2 cups plus 3 tablespoons all-purpose flour",
            "3 tablespoons plus 1 cup sugar",
            "1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder",
            "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt",
            "6 tablespoons (3/4 stick) chilled unsalted butter, cut into 1/2\" pieces",
            "1/2 cup plus 1 tablespoon cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche or sour cream",
            "6 cups fresh blueberries (about 2 pounds)",

        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Preheat oven to 375\u00b0F. Whisk 1 1/2 cups flour, 3 tablespoons sugar, baking powder, and salt in a large bowl. Add butter; using your fingertips, incorporate until only pea-size lumps remain. Gently mix in cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche. Knead in bowl until a biscuit-like dough forms, 5-7 turns (overmixing will make dough tough).",
            "Combine remaining 1 cup sugar, remaining 3 tablespoons flour, berries, juice, and zest in a large bowl. Toss to coat. Pour into an 8x8x2\" glass baking dish or divide among six 6-ounce ramekins. Tear biscuit topping into quarter-size crumbles; scatter over berries.",
            "Bake cobbler until juices are thick and bubbling and topping is cooked through and deep golden brown, 20-25 minutes for ramekins or 45-50 minutes for baking dish. Let cool for at least 1 hour."
