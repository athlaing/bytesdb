            "1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour",
            "1/2 teaspoon baking powder",
            "1/4 teaspoon salt",
            "1 stick (1/2 cup) unsalted butter, softened",
            "1/2 cup sugar",
            "1/2 cup well-stirred tahini",
            "1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract",
            "1/3 cup sesame seeds (preferably hulled)",
            "1/4 teaspoon gold or silver luster dust (optional)",
            "parchment paper"

        "instructions": [
            "Whisk together flour, baking powder, and salt in a small bowl. Beat together butter and sugar in a large bowl with an electric mixer at medium-high speed until pale and fluffy, about 3 minutes, then beat in tahini and vanilla. Reduce speed to low and add flour mixture in 2 batches, mixing until a crumbly dough forms. Transfer dough to a sheet of plastic wrap and press into a disk. Chill dough, wrapped in plastic wrap, until firm, at least 1 hour. Put oven racks in upper and lower thirds of oven and preheat oven to 350\u00b0F. Line 2 large baking sheets with parchment paper. Stir together sesame seeds and luster dust (if using) in a small bowl. Roll dough into 1-inch balls, then roll balls 1 at a time in seeds to coat and arrange 2 inches apart on lined baking sheets. Bake, switching position of sheets halfway through baking, until cookies are puffed and starting to crack, 12 to 15 minutes total. Cool on sheets 10 minutes (cookies will be very fragile when hot), then transfer from parchment to a rack to cool completely.",
