        "ingredients": [
            "Nonstick vegetable oil spray",
            "1 cup sugar",
            "1/2 cup light corn syrup",
            "1 cup unsalted, shelled raw natural pistachios, very coarsely chopped",
            "1 tablespoon unsalted butter",
            "1 teaspoon kosher salt",
            "3/4 teaspoon baking soda",
            "Coarse gray sea salt (such as fleur de sel or sel gris)",
            "A candy thermometer"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper; spray with nonstick spray and set aside. Whisk sugar, corn syrup, and 3 tablespoons water in a medium saucepan. Stir over medium heat until sugar dissolves. Fit saucepan with candy thermometer, bring mixture to a boil, and cook until thermometer registers 290\u00b0F, 3-4 minutes. Using a heatproof spatula, stir in pistachios, butter, and kosher salt (syrup will seize initially, but will melt as it heats back up). Continue to cook syrup, stirring often, until thermometer registers 300\u00b0F and pistachios are golden brown, 3-4 minutes. Caramel should be pale brown (it will darken slightly as it cools). Sprinkle baking soda over and stir quickly to blend caramel thoroughly (mixture will bubble vigorously). Immediately pour caramel onto prepared baking sheet and, using a heatproof spatula, quickly spread out as thin as possible. Sprinkle sea salt over and let caramel cool completely. Break brittle into pieces. DO AHEAD: Brittle can be made 1 week ahead. Store airtight between sheets of parchment paper (to prevent sticking) at room temperature.",
