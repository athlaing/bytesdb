        "title": "French \"Peasant\" Beets ",
        "ingredients": [
            "4 to 6 beets with greens (I like a mixture of golden and red beets)",
            "1 bunch Swiss chard, rinsed and dried",
            "3 tablespoons unsalted butter",
            "1 shallot, minced",
            "Salt and freshly ground black pepper",
            "2 tablespoons white wine (Muscadet is my preference)",
            "1/2 pound Bucheron (at room temperature), cut into 4 wedges",
            "Crusty peasant-style bread (warmed in the oven)"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "1. Scrub and peel the beets. Remove the greens, wash and dry them, and chop coarsely. Set the greens aside in a large prep bowl. Slice the beets into 1/4-inch rounds.",
            "2. Remove the ribs from the Swiss chard and coarsely chop the ribs. Toss the leaves and ribs into the bowl with the beet greens.",
            "3. In a large saut\u00e9 pan, melt the butter and saut\u00e9 the shallot over medium heat until softened.",
            "Add the beet rounds to the shallot-butter mixture. Toss in a pinch of salt and crack some pepper over the beets. Reduce the heat and saut\u00e9 the beets, turning to ensure even cooking, until the beets are beginning to glaze and become tender, about 15 minutes.",

            "Add the beet greens, chard, and chard ribs and saut\u00e9 for about 5 minutes, then add the wine and cover. Cook until the greens are wilted, adding 2 tablespoons water if necessary. Allow the liquid to be mostly absorbed into the greens. Adjust the seasonings.",
