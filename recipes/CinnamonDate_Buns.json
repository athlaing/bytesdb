        "instructions": [
            "Bring dates, salt, and 1 1/2 cups water to a boil in a medium saucepan. Reduce heat and simmer, stirring and mashing occasionally, until dates are falling apart and water is evaporated (it should be a thick paste), 10-15 minutes. Let cool, then stir in butter, orange zest, and cinnamon.",
            "Do ahead: Date filling can be made 1 week ahead. Cover and chill. Bring to room temperature before using.",
            "Dough and assembly: Preheat oven to 375\u00b0. Heat milk and 1 tablespoon honey in a small saucepan until lukewarm. Combine milk mixture and yeast in the bowl of a stand mixer. As soon as yeast is foamy, about 5 minutes, add egg yolks, 1 egg, buttermilk, spelt flour, salt, 2 cups all-purpose flour, and remaining 3 tablespoons honey; mix on medium speed until dough is smooth, shiny, and elastic, 5-8 minutes. With motor running, add 1/2 cup room temperature butter, 1 piece at a time, waiting until each piece is incorporated before adding the next. Mix 1 minute, then increase speed to medium-high and mix until dough is soft and supple, 6-8 minutes. (No stand mixer? Whisk ingredients into yeast mixture in a large bowl, then knead dough on a clean surface. Mix in butter with a sturdy wooden spoon, then knead briefly to make sure butter is well incorporated.) Place dough in a buttered medium bowl. Brush with melted butter; cover with plastic wrap. Let dough rise in a warm spot until doubled in size, 1\u20131 1/2 hours (2\u20132 1/2 hours if dough was made ahead and chilled). Divide dough in half. Roll out 1 piece on a lightly floured surface to a 15x5\" rectangle. Evenly spread with half of date filling and cut into 8 triangles. Starting with a pointy end, roll up dough (like a reverse crescent roll). Place, seam side down, on a parchment-lined baking sheet. Repeat with remaining dough, date filling, and another baking sheet. Cover buns with plastic wrap and let rise in a warm spot until almost doubled in size, 30\u201340 minutes. Mix sugar and cinnamon in a small bowl. Whisk remaining egg and 1 teaspoon water in another small bowl and brush over buns. Sprinkle with cinnamon sugar; bake until golden brown, 20\u201325 minutes. Let cool slightly before serving. Do ahead: Dough (before rise) can be made 1 day ahead. Cover and chill.",
