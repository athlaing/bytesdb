        "ingredients": [
            "1 cup firmly packed light brown sugar",
            "1/4 cup light corn syrup",
            "1/2 stick (1/4 cup) unsalted butter",
            "1/2 cup heavy cream",
            "1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla",
            "1/4 teaspoon fresh lemon juice",
            "1 1/2 tablespoons dark rum, or to taste",
            "1/2 cup coarsely chopped pecans, toasted, if desired"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "In a small heavy saucepan combine the brown sugar, the corn syrup, the butter, and a pinch of salt, cook the mixture over moderate heat, stirring and washing down any sugar crystals clinging to the side with a brush dipped in cold water, until the sugar is dissolved, and boil it, undisturbed, for 12 minutes, or until a candy thermometer registers 280\u00b0F. Remove the pan from the heat and stir in the cream, the vanilla, the lemon juice, the rum, and the pecans. Serve the sauce warm or at room temperature. The sauce keeps, chilled, for 2 months."
