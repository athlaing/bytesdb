        "title": "Wilted Mustard Greens Salad with Bacon ",
        "ingredients": [
            "1/2 pound mustard greens, stems and center ribs cut out and discarded and the leaves cut crosswise into 1/2-inch-wide strips",
            "3 tablespoons olive oil",
            "1 1/2 teaspoons mustard seeds",
            "1 small onion, chopped fine",
            "1 1/2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar",
            "2 slices of bacon, cooked until crisp and crumbled"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Wash the mustard greens, spin them dry, and put them in a large heatproof bowl. In a skillet heat the oil with the mustard seeds, covered partially to keep the seeds from popping out, over moderate heat for 2 to 4 minutes, or until the popping subsides, add the onion, and cook the mixture, stirring, until the onion is softened. Remove the skillet from the heat, stir in the vinegar, and bring the mixture to a boil. Drizzle the dressing immediately over the mustard greens and toss the salad. Add the bacon and salt and pepper to taste and toss the salad well."
