        "ingredients": [
            "3/4 pound (3/4 box) spaghetti",
            "Coarse salt",
            "1 lemon",
            "1 1/2 cups finely grated fresh Parmesan cheese",
            "1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper",
            "2 1/2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil",
            "3-5 tablespoons of pasta water, to thin",
            "Handful fresh basil leaves (from 4 leafy stems)"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Boil the spaghetti in salted boiling water, according to the package directions.",
            "Meanwhile, using a Microplane, grate the zest from the lemon into a large mixing bowl. Cut the lemon in half and squeeze the juice into the bowl (I like to use the grater as a strainer\u2014one less thing to clean). Add the 1 1/2 cups Parmesan, pepper, and a pinch of salt, and mix in the olive oil to form a wet paste.",
            "When the spaghetti is perfectly cooked, add 2 or 3 tablespoons of the cooking water to the lemon and cheese mixture. Add the spaghetti to the bowl and toss thoroughly, adding another tablespoon or 2 of pasta water if necessary so that the sauce coats each strand. Roughly tear in the basil leaves.",
            "Serve each portion with a sprinkle of coarse salt, a fresh grind of black pepper, and a few gratings of extra Parmesan."
