            "Whisk 2 large eggs, 1/3 cup granulated sugar, 1 tablespoon light brown sugar, 1 tablespoon honey, and 2 teaspoons finely grated lemon or orange zest in a medium bowl until smooth. Whisk in dry ingredients until just incorporated, then whisk in 6 tablespoons warm melted unsalted butter until smooth. Transfer batter to a pastry bag or resealable plastic bag and chill at least 1 hour.",
            "Preheat oven to 400\u00b0. Lightly coat a 12-cake regular madeleine pan or three 20-cake mini madeleine pans with nonstick vegetable oil spray and dust with flour, tapping out excess. Snip end off pastry bag (or 1 corner of resealable plastic bag) and pipe batter into pan, filling two-thirds full (you may have a little batter left over).",
