        "title": "Tacos of Carnitas Roasted with Orange, Milk, and Pepper ",
        "ingredients": [
            "3 pounds boneless pork shoulder (butt) or boneless country pork ribs",
            "1 tablespoon lard",
            "1/2 teaspoon salt",
            "1/2 orange, well washed",
            "1 cup whole milk",
            "About 2 cups water",
            "1/2 teaspoon fresh-ground black pepper",
            "Warm corn tortillas",
            "Diced avocado, lightly salted",
            "Raw tomatillo salsa",
            "Chicharr\u00f3nes espumas (skin), crumbled (see note)",
            "Diced white onion",
            "Cilantro sprigs"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.",
            "2. Cut the pork into 6 or 8 pieces. Melt the lard in a heavy Dutch oven just large enough to hold the meat in one layer. Brown the meat on all sides and season with salt.",
            "3. Squeeze the orange over the meat and toss the rind into the pan. Pour the milk over the meat and add enough water to almost cover the meat. Sprinkle with pepper. Cover tightly with aluminum foil and bake for about 2 hours, until the meat is fork-tender.",
            "4. To finish, uncover the meat and break into into largish pieces. Remove the orange rind and discard. Roast, uncovered, until most of the liquid has evaporated, about 20 minutes, or until the meat is brown and crisp on the edges.",
            "5. To assemble the tacos, fill a warm tortilla with shredded pork. Top with avocado and salsa, a little of the chicharr\u00f3n, and finish with generous amounts of onion and cilantro."
