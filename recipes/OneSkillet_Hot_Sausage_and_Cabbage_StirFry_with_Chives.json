            "Using your hands or a wooden spoon, work ginger and garlic into sausage in a medium bowl. Heat 2 Tbsp. vegetable oil in a large skillet, preferably cast iron, over medium-high and cook sausage mixture, breaking up with a wooden spoon, until browned, crisp, and cooked through, 6\u20138 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer sausage mixture to a clean bowl.",

Add half of cabbage and cook, tossing often, until cabbage is wilted and tender, about 4 minutes. Drizzle in vinegar and soy sauce and cook, tossing, until liquid is mostly reduced and skillet is dry in spots, about 2 minutes.",
            "Remove skillet from heat and mix chives, sausage, and remaining cabbage into stir-fry. Drizzle with sesame oil and sprinkle with sesame seeds.",
            "Serve stir-fry with tortillas, hoisin sauce, and Sriracha for making individual wraps."
