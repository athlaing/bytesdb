        "title": "Twice-Roasted Sweet Potatoes With Hot Honey ",
        "ingredients": [
            "3 medium sweet potatoes or garnet yams, scrubbed (about 3 pounds)",
            "1 Fresno or other red chiles, thinly sliced",
            "1/4 cup honey",
            "4 tablespoons unsalted butter",
            "Kosher salt",
            "2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Preheat oven to 350\u00b0F. Poke holes all over sweet potatoes and wrap each in foil. Place on a foil-lined rimmed baking sheet and roast until potatoes are tender, 60\u201370 minutes (if you have one, use a cake tester to poke right through foil). Unwrap and let sit until cool enough to handle. Increase oven temperature to 450\u00b0F. Meanwhile, combine chile, honey, and butter in a small saucepan; season with salt. Bring to a simmer over low heat, stirring to combine. Remove from heat and stir in vinegar.",
            "Smash sweet potatoes with your palm, then tear into bite-sized pieces (including skin), the more irregular, the better. Place in a large bowl and add half of hot honey (do not include chile as it will burn); season with salt. Arrange pieces, skin side down, in a single layer on an unlined rimmed baking sheet and roast until browned and crisp around the edges, 20\u201325 minutes. Drizzle with remaining hot honey with chile."
