            "For cake: Position rack in center of oven and preheat to 325\u00b0F. Butter and flour 10-inch-diameter springform pan. Toss apple slices, cinnamon, and cloves in medium bowl. Sift flour, cornstarch, baking powder, and salt into another bowl. Combine butter, powdered sugar, and lemon peel in large bowl; scrape in seeds from vanilla bean. Using electric mixer, beat butter mixture until well blended. Add eggs 1 at a time, beating until well blended after each addition; beat in egg yolk. Add flour mixture and beat just until blended.

Bake cake until streusel topping is crisp and tester inserted into center of cake comes out clean, about 1 hour 20 minutes. Cool cake in pan on rack 15 minutes. Remove pan sides; cool to lukewarm. Serve lukewarm or at room temperature. DO AHEAD Can be made 1 day ahead. Cool completely. Wrap cake in foil and store at room temperature.",
