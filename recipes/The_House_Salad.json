            "1 small jicama, peeled and cut into 1/4-inch matchsticks (roughly 1/2 cup)",
            "1/3 cup pomegranate seeds",
            "1 cup large shavings Asiago or Parmesan cheese",
            "2 1/2 tablespoons cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche",
            "2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil",
            "1 teaspoon honey",
            "1 scallion, white part only, finely chopped",
            "2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar",

        "instructions": [
            "To make the dressing, whisk together the cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche, olive oil, and honey. Add the scallion, vinegar, salt, and pepper and whisk again. Taste and add salt and pepper to taste, or a touch more vinegar if you prefer your dressing on the acidic side.",
            "Gently pull the lettuce leaves from the head, making sure they are dry. Gently toss the leaves and jicama with the dressing. Assemble in a stack on each of 4 plates, starting with the largest leaves on the bottom to create a base. Garnish each salad with a quarter of the pomegranate seeds and the cheese shavings. Serve immediately."
