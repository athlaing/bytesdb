            "1/2 cup/120 ml honey",
            "1 cup/240 ml water",
            "3 to 4 cloves",
            "6 cinnamon sticks",
            "1 whole vanilla bean pod (about 3 in/7.5 cm long)",
            "One 1-in/2.5-cm strip orange rind",
            "1 small chunk from a whole nutmeg, or 1/4 tsp ground",

        ],
        "instructions": [
            "In a medium saucepan, bring the honey and water to a boil, skimming any foam from the surface. Add the cloves, cinnamon sticks, vanilla bean pod, and orange rind, return to a boil, and remove from the heat. Let sit for 1 or 2 minutes, then bring to a boil again. Remove from the heat, cover, and set aside for at least 30 minutes to steep. Strain through a fine-mesh strainer or a regular strainer lined with a coffee filter or cheesecloth, and again bring to a boil. Pour in the vodka. Stir well and serve piping hot."
