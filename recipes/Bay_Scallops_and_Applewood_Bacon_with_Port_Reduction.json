        "ingredients": [
            "2 cups Ruby Port (500 ml)",
            "1/2 cup superfine granulated sugar",
            "1 1/2 teaspoons whole black peppercorns",
            "2 fresh mint leaves, torn into bits",
            "6 thin crosswise slices applewood-smoked bacon (1/4 lb), cut into thirds",
            "18 bay scallops (preferably Nantucket; 1/3 lb), tough muscle from side of each discarded if attached",
            "1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil",
            "1 tablespoon unsalted butter",

        "instructions": [
            "Bring Port, superfine sugar, peppercorns, and mint to a simmer in a 2-quart saucepan over moderately low heat, stirring until sugar is dissolved. Remove from heat, then carefully ignite Port with a kitchen match, letting flames die down (this will take a few minutes). Simmer over moderately low heat until sauce is thickened and reduced to about 1/2 cup, about 15 minutes. Transfer to a bowl and cool to warm.",
            "Cook scallops: Heat a 12-inch heavy skillet over moderate heat, then cook bacon until some fat has rendered and edges of bacon start to brown, about 1 1/2 minutes per side. Transfer bacon to paper towels to drain. Pat scallops dry and season with salt and pepper. When bacon is cool enough to handle, wrap a piece of bacon around each scallop and pierce scallop with a wooden pick to secure. Heat oil and butter in cleaned skillet over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking, then saut\u00e9 scallops, turning over once, until bacon is browned and scallops are opaque, about 5 minutes total. Transfer to a plate and serve with Port reduction for dipping.",
