            "1/4 pound coarsely grated extra-sharp Cheddar (1 1/2 cups)",
            "1 cup all-purpose flour",
            "3/4 stick cold unsalted butter, cut into tablespoons",
            "1/2 teaspoon salt",
            "Rounded 1/8 teaspoon cayenne",
            "1 1/2 tablespoons milk"

        "instructions": [
            "Preheat oven to 350\u00b0F with racks in upper and lower thirds. Pulse cheese, flour, butter, salt, and cayenne in a food processor until mixture resembles coarse meal. Add milk and pulse until dough forms a ball. Roll out dough on a lightly floured surface with a lightly floured rolling pin into a 12- by 10-inch rectangle (1/8 inch thick). Cut dough with a lightly floured pizza wheel or lightly floured sharp knife into 1/3-inch-wide strips. Carefully transfer to 2 ungreased baking sheets, arranging strips 1/4 inch apart. (If strips tear, pinch back together.) Bake, switching position of sheets halfway through baking, until pale golden, 15 to 18 minutes. Cool completely on baking sheets on racks, about 15 minutes.",
