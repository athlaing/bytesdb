            "7/8 cup flour",

            "1/8 teaspoon salt",
            "3 eggs",
            "1 teaspoon grated lemon rind (or a little grated vanilla bean)",
            "2 tablespoons cognac",

            "For this basic cr\u00eape recipe, sift flour, sugar, and salt. Add eggs, one at a time, and mix until no lumps remain (you may use an electric mixer at slow speed). Mix in lemon rind or vanilla, cognac, and melted butter. Slowly add milk and mix until batter is consistency of thin cream. Let it stand an hour or two before making cr\u00eapes. Heat a cr\u00eape pan (either 6-inch or 10-inch, according to desired size of cr\u00eapes) and rub it with butter. (It should sizzle on touching pan) For each cr\u00eape, pour a little batter into the pan, tilting about to let it run, covering the bottom in a fairly thin layer. When lightly browned on the bottom, turn carefully with spatula. Pat turned cr\u00eape flat with fingers and brown other side. As each cr\u00eape is cooked, remove it to a hot platter and keep warm. Re-butter pan as needed.",
