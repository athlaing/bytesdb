            "Whisk vinegar and garlic in small bowl. Gradually whisk in olive oil. Season vinaigrette to taste with salt and pepper. Prepare barbecue (medium-high heat). Place corn, chiles, and bell peppers on grill. Cover and grill until corn kernels are tender and chiles and bell peppers are blackened on all sides, turning frequently, about 5 minutes for corn and 12 minutes for chiles and bell peppers. Transfer vegetables to 2 baking pans. Cover chiles and bell peppers; let stand until cool. Cut corn kernels off cobs; transfer to medium bowl. Peel, seed, and coarsely chop chiles and bell peppers; add to bowl with corn. DO AHEAD: Vinaigrette and vegetables can be made 1 day ahead. Cover separately; chill. Bring vinaigrette to room temperature and rewhisk before using. Stir cumin seeds in small dry skillet over medium heat until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Transfer to small bowl; set aside. Cook potatoes in large pot of boiling salted water just until tender when pierced with knife, about 20 minutes. Drain. Rinse under cold water. Drain and cool slightly. Cut potatoes into 1/3- to 1/2-inch-thick slices. Transfer to large bowl. Add grilled vegetables and vinaigrette; toss to coat. Add cumin seeds, green onions, and cilantro and toss. Season generously with salt and pepper. Cover; chill at least 2 hours. DO AHEAD: Can be made 8 hours ahead. Keep refrigerated. Serve chilled or at room temperature.",
