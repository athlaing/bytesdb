        "ingredients": [
            "6 1/2 cups (about) vegetable broth",
            "3 tablespoons unsalted butter, divided",
            "1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil",
            "1 8-ounce onion, chopped",
            "1 medium leek (white part only), sliced crosswise into thin rings",
            "2 stalks green garlic, chopped, or 1 garlic clove, minced",
            "2 cups arborio rice or carnaroli rice",
            "1/2 cup dry white wine",
            "1 cup 1-inch pieces thin asparagus",
            "1 cup freshly shelled small peas or petite frozen peas (about 1/4 pound)",
            "1/4 cup chopped fresh Italian parsley",
            "3/4 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese, plus additional for serving"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Bring broth to simmer in medium saucepan. Cover; keep warm over low heat. Melt 1 tablespoon butter with oil in heavy large saucepan over medium-low heat. Add onion, leek, and garlic. Saut\u00e9 until wilted and almost tender, about 6 minutes. Add rice; stir until rice is translucent at edges but still opaque in center, about 3 minutes. Add wine; simmer until almost all liquid is absorbed, stirring often, about 1 minute. Add broth 1 cup at a time until rice is about half cooked, allowing each addition to be absorbed before adding next and stirring often, about 9 minutes. Stir in asparagus, peas (if using fresh), and parsley. Continue adding broth by cupfuls and stirring until rice is almost tender, about 6 minutes longer. Add peas (if using frozen). Cook until rice is tender but still firm to bite and mixture is creamy, about 2 minutes longer. Remove from heat. Add 3/4 cup cheese and 2 tablespoons butter. Stir until cheese and butter melt. Season with salt and pepper. Serve, passing additional cheese alongside."
