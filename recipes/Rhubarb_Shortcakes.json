        "ingredients": [
            "2 pounds rhubarb, trimmed, sliced 1\" thick",
            "1 cup sugar",
            "1/2 cup red wine",
            "1 vanilla bean, split lengthwise",
            "1 cup cake flour",
            "4 teaspoons baking powder",
            "1 tablespoon sugar",
            "1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt",
            "1 cup all-purpose flour plus more for work surface",
            "3 cups chilled heavy cream, divided",
            "1/4 cup (1/2 stick) unsalted butter, melted"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Preheat oven to 350\u00b0F. Combine rhubarb, sugar, and wine in a medium baking dish or ovenproof skillet. Scrape in seeds from vanilla bean; add bean and toss to combine.",
            "Roast until rhubarb is very tender and juices are syrupy, 30-40 minutes, depending on thickness of stalks. Let cool. Discard vanilla bean.",
            "For biscuits and assembly: Preheat oven to 375\u00b0F. Whisk cake flour, baking powder, sugar, salt, and 1 cup all-purpose flour in a medium bowl to combine. Add 1 1/2 cups cream; gently mix just until dough holds together. Transfer dough to a lightly floured surface and form into a 9x6\" rectangle about 1\" thick. Cut dough in half lengthwise, then cut crosswise 3 times to form 8 rectangular biscuits. Arrange biscuits on a parchment paper- lined baking sheet, spacing 1\" apart. Brush tops and sides of biscuits with butter. Bake until golden brown, 18-20 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack; let cool (biscuits can be served warm or at room temperature). Beat remaining 1 1/2 cups cream in a medium bowl until soft peaks form. Split biscuits and brush cut sides with remaining melted butter. Fill biscuits with roasted rhubarb and serve with whipped cream. DO AHEAD: Rhubarb filling can be made 5 days ahead. Let cool, then cover and chill. Reheat slightly before serving. Biscuits can be made 1 day ahead. Let cool completely and store airtight at room temperature.",
