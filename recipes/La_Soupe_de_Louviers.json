        "instructions": [
            "1. Place the oil and the onions in a heavy stockpot over medium heat and cook until the onion begins to turn translucent and give up some of its liquid, about 4 minutes. Add the leeks, the turnips, the carrot, and the celery, stir and cook, stirring frequently, until all of the vegetables are translucent but not limp, about 15 minutes. Add the potatoes and the cabbage, stir, then pour over the water. Add the remaining ingredients, stir, cover and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium low so the soup is simmering merrily and cook until the vegetables are tender through but not mushy, about 20 minutes. Adjust the seasoning and remove the bay leaves, the cloves, and the thyme.",
            "2. To serve, ladle the soup into 6 warmed, shallow soup bowls. Sprinkle each serving with a pinch of freshly grated nutmeg and serve immediately."
