            "Pour apple cider and cognac into a Collins glass filled with ice. Light a match, let it burn 2 seconds to get rid of excess sulfur, and hold it 3\" over cocktail and 1\" away from peel; the outside of the peel should face down, over the drink. Squeeze peel to release oils into drink. Rub flamed peel around rim of glass, then place peel in glass.",
