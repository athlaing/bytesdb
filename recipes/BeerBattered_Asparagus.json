        "ingredients": [
            "1/2 cup mayonnaise",
            "1 teaspoon fresh lemon juice",
            "1/2 teaspoon finely grated fresh lemon zest",
            "1/4 teaspoon black pepper",
            "1 cup all-purpose flour",
            "1 teaspoon salt",
            "1 tablespoon finely grated fresh lemon zest",
            "1/4 teaspoon black pepper",
            "1 cup lager such as Harp (pour beer slowly into measuring cup; do not measure foam)",
            "About 4 cups vegetable oil",
            "1 lb medium asparagus, trimmed and cut into 3-inch pieces",
            "a deep-fat thermometer"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Stir together mayonnaise, lemon juice, zest, and pepper in a small bowl. Chill, covered, until ready to use.",
            "Make batter and fry asparagus: Put oven rack in middle position and preheat oven to 200\u00b0F. Whisk together flour, salt, zest, and pepper in a bowl until combined, then add beer, whisking until smooth. Heat 3 inches oil in a 3- to 4-quart heavy saucepan over moderately high heat until it registers 375\u00b0F on thermometer. Submerge asparagus spears in batter to coat. Working in batches of 10, drag 1 at a time gently against rim to remove excess batter, then transfer to oil and fry, stirring gently to keep asparagus from sticking together, until golden, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer as fried with a slotted spoon to a paper-towel-lined baking sheet and keep warm in oven. Return oil to 375\u00b0F between batches. Serve with lemon dipping sauce.",
