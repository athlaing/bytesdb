            "4 garlic cloves, thinly sliced",

            "1 cup beer",
            "1 cup cherry tomatoes",
            "1 (15.5-ounce) can chickpeas, rinsed",
            "2 tablespoons (or more) sambal oelek",
            "24 littleneck clams, scrubbed",
            "1 tablespoon fresh lime juice",

        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Prepare a grill for medium, indirect heat (for a gas grill, leave one or two burners off; for a charcoal grill, bank coals on one side of grill). Place a large cast-iron skillet on grill over direct heat (move it around to cooler part of grill as you cook if needed) and melt 4 Tbsp. butter in skillet. Add shallots and garlic and cook, stirring often, until soft, about 4 minutes. Add tomato paste and cook, stirring often, until paste darkens to a rich brick-red color, about 1 minute. Add beer and tomatoes. Bring to a boil and cook until beer is reduced nearly by half and no longer smells boozy, about 4 minutes. Stir in chickpeas and sambal oelek, then add clams. Cover (if you don\u2019t have a lid that fits, use a sheet of foil) and cook, stirring occasionally, until clams have opened; this could take from 5\u201310 minutes depending on size of clams and the heat level. Remove from heat; discard any clams that don\u2019t open. Stir in lime juice and remaining 2 Tbsp. butter.",
            "While the clams are cooking on the grill, drizzle bread with oil and season lightly with salt. Grill until golden brown and crisp, about 2 minutes per side.",
            "Transfer toast to plates and spoon clam mixture over; top with cilantro. Serve with lime wedges for squeezing over."
