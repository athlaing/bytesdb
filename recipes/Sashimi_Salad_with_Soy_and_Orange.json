        "ingredients": [
            "4 oranges",
            "1 or 2 limes",
            "1 tablespoon soy sauce",
            "3 tablespoons grapeseed oil",
            "6 cups m\u00e2che (lamb's lettuce) leaves",
            "2 cups fris\u00e9e lettuce, torn into bite-size pieces",
            "1/2 cucumber, peeled, seeded, and thinly sliced (optional)",
            "7 ounces sushi-grade salmon, skin removed",
            "1 teaspoon sesame seeds, toasted"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Grate the zest of 1 orange and the lime into a large bowl. Squeeze 1 tablespoon of juice from the grated orange and 2 tablespoons of juice from the grated lime into the bowl (you may need a second lime to get the 2 tablespoons of juice). Whisk in the soy sauce and the oil. Set the dressing aside. Use a sharp knife to slice the rind and pith from the remaining oranges. Working over a mixing bowl, cut between the membranes to free the orange segments, letting them drop into the bowl. Pour any juice into a cup and reserve it for another use. Add the m\u00e2che, fris\u00e9e, and cucumbers, if using, to the orange segments. Using a large sharp knife, cut the salmon into 1/3-inch-thick slices. Add the salmon to the bowl. Drizzle with the dressing, and toss gently to coat. Allow the flavors to meld for at least 2 minutes. Divide the salad among 4 serving plates. Sprinkle with the toasted sesame seeds, and serve.",
