            "1/4 cup (1 ounce) crystallized ginger, finely chopped",
            "4 tablespoons honey",

            "In a bowl, whisk together yogurt, pudding, crystallized ginger, honey and vanilla until smooth. Freeze until solid, 4 to 6 hours. Remove from freezer and defrost slightly, 15 minutes. In a medium saucepan, bring to a low boil peaches, 1 tablespoon water, sugar, fresh ginger and cinnamon; reduce heat and simmer until liquid thickens and peaches soften slightly, 4 to 5 minutes. Remove from heat; let cool. In a food processor, process frozen yogurt-pudding mixture until smooth. Divide fro yo and peach compote among 6 bowls; sprinkle with cinnamon."
