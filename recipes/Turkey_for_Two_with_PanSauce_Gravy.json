        "title": "Turkey for Two with Pan-Sauce Gravy ",
        "ingredients": [
            "1 split skin-on, bone-in turkey breast (about 2 lb.)",
            "2 tsp. kosher salt",
            "1 tsp. freshly ground black pepper",
            "1 Tbsp. vegetable oil",
            "2/3 cup dry white wine",
            "2 sprigs thyme",
            "1 sprig rosemary",
            "1 sprig sage",
            "2 garlic cloves, crushed",
            "1 tsp. cornstarch",
            "1 Tbsp. cold unsalted butter, cut into small pieces"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Preheat oven to 350\u00b0F. Season turkey with salt and pepper. Let sit at room temperature at least 30 minutes or up to 1 hour, which will help the turkey cook more quickly and evenly.",
            "Heat oil in a 10\" ovenproof skillet over high until just barely smoking. Sear turkey skin side down until deeply golden brown, about 5 minutes; transfer to a plate. Add wine to skillet, scraping up browned bits with a spatula, and cook until liquid is reduced by half, about 2 minutes. Remove from heat, add thyme, rosemary, sage, garlic, cornstarch, and 2/3 cup water, and whisk to combine.",
            "Place breast skin side up in liquid in skillet and transfer skillet to oven. Roast, checking every 20 minutes or so and adding 1/4 cup more water if liquid under turkey is evaporating lower than 1\" in pan, until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of breast without touching bone registers 150\u00b0F, about 50 minutes (temperature will continue to rise as turkey rests).",
            "Transfer turkey to a cutting board and let rest 10 minutes before slicing.",
            "Meanwhile, remove herb sprigs from skillet and discard. Whisk liquid remaining in skillet until garlic mostly dissolves, adding a splash of water and heating over high if needed to loosen (gravy should be thick but easily pourable). Whisk butter into gravy until melted. Strain gravy through a fine-mesh sieve into a small pitcher or bowl.",
            "Serve turkey with gravy alongside."
