            "Make praline cream: Lightly oil rimmed baking sheet. Combine 1/2 cup sugar and 2 tablespoons water in heavy small saucepan over medium-low heat. Stir until sugar dissolves. Increase heat to medium-high and boil without stirring until mixture turns deep amber color, brushing down sides of pan with wet pastry brush and swirling occasionally, about 6 minutes. Stir in sliced almonds. Immediately pour mixture onto prepared sheet. Cool. Break praline into pieces and finely grind in processor. Whisk egg yolks, egg, remaining 3/4 cup sugar, and 1/4 cup water in large bowl to blend. Set over saucepan of simmering water and whisk until mixture thickens and instant-read thermometer registers 160\u00b0F, about 5 minutes. Remove bowl from over water. Using electric mixer, beat mixture until thick and cool, about 5 minutes. Whisk in corn syrup, liqueur, and espresso powder. Fold in ground praline. Using electric mixer, beat whipping cream in another large bowl until stiff peaks form. Fold whipped cream into praline mixture. Spread praline cream over almond meringue in pan, smoothing top. Freeze overnight. (Can be made up to 1 week ahead. Cover tightly and keep frozen.) Cut cake into slices and serve frozen.",
