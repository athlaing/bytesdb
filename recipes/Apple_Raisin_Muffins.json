In a large bowl with an electric mixer beat together the egg and the brown sugar until the mixture is thick and pale, add the sour cream and the vanilla, and beat the mixture until it is combined well. Beat in the flour mixture, a little at a time, and beat the batter until it just combined.

Bake the muffins in the middle of a 350\u00b0F. oven for 20 to 25 minutes, or until a tester comes out clean, turn them onto a rack, and let them cool.",
