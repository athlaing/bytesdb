            "1 cup cornmeal",
            "1 cup all-purpose flour",
            "6 ounces Manchego cheese, grated",
            "1/4 cup granulated sugar",
            "1 tablespoon baking powder",
            "1 teaspoon salt",
            "2 tablespoons pickled sliced jalape\u00f1o peppers",
            "1 cup milk",

        "instructions": [
            "Preheat the oven to 400\u00b0F. Grease an 8-inch-square baking pan. Combine the cornmeal, flour, 4 ounces of the grated Manchego, the sugar, baking powder, and salt in a medium bowl. Mince 1 tablespoon of the jalape\u00f1os and combine it with the milk, oil, and eggs in a small bowl; mix well. Add the milk mixture to the flour mixture and stir just until blended. Pour into the prepared pan. Lay the remaining jalape\u00f1o slices on top of the batter approximately 3 inches apart (the idea is for each piece of cornbread to get a slice of jalape\u00f1o on top) and sprinkle with the remaining 2 ounces of Manchego. Bake for 20 to 25 minutes, or until a wooden pick inserted into center comes out clean. Serve warm.",
