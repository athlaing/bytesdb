        "ingredients": [
            "160 grams (4 or 5) thick asparagus spears",
            "1 avocado, halved, pitted, and peeled",
            "16 fresh mint leaves, chopped",
            "1/2 lime",
            "20 grams (about 2 tablespoons) extra-virgin olive oil",
            "Pinch of fine sea salt per serving"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "1 Cut away about 2 inches of the base of each asparagus spear. With a vegetable peeler, shave the entire asparagus from bottom to top, reversing your grip and rotating as necessary to shave as much as possible. Don't rush it; be deliberate for the greatest precision.",
            "2 Divide the asparagus strips among 4 salad plates. Cut each avocado half into 4 sections and place 2 wedges on each salad. Sprinkle with the mint leaves. Squeeze lime juice over the salads, drizzle evenly with the oil, and sprinkle with salt."
