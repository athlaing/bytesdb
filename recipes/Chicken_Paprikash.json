            "Preheat oven to 325\u00b0F. Cut 1 Dai Due's Master Brined Chicken into 8 pieces; season with salt and pepper. Heat 3 tablespoons unsalted butter in an ovenproof skillet just large enough to hold chicken pieces in a single layer over high. Once butter is melted, cook chicken, skin side down, until skin is very well browned (do not disturb), 5\u20138 minutes. Transfer chicken to a plate (do not cook flesh side). Reduce heat to medium and add 2 thinly sliced onions, 5 teaspoons sweet Hungarian paprika, and 1 teaspoon hot smoked Spanish paprika to skillet; season with salt. Cook, stirring often, until onions are softened and start sticking to the skillet, 8\u201310 minutes. Add 2 cups low-sodium chicken broth and bring to a simmer. Return chicken to skillet, skin side up, and transfer to oven. Bake until chicken is cooked through, 25\u201330 minutes. Transfer chicken to a platter; tent with foil to keep warm. Bring liquid in skillet to a boil and cook until reduced by one-third, 5\u20137 minutes. Remove from heat and whisk in 1 cup room temperature sour cream and 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice; season with salt and pepper. Spoon sauce around chicken; top with chopped fresh parsley.",
