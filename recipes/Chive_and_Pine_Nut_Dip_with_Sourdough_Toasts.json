        "ingredients": [
            "3/4 cup coarsely chopped fresh chives plus 2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh chives (2 to 3 bunches)",
            "1/4 cup vegetable oil",
            "3/8 teaspoon salt",
            "1 (12-inch-long) sourdough baguette, sliced diagonally 1/8 inch thick",
            "1/4 cup pine nuts (1 oz)",
            "2/3 cup mascarpone (4 3/4 oz) at room temperature",
            "2 tablespoons cream cheese at room temperature"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Pur\u00e9e 3/4 cup chives with oil and 1/8 teaspoon salt in a blender until smooth, then chill 1 hour. While chive oil stands, put oven racks in upper and lower thirds of oven and preheat oven to 375\u00b0F. Divide bread slices between 2 baking sheets and toast, switching position of sheets halfway through toasting, until golden, 8 to 10 minutes. Leave oven on. Toast pine nuts in a shallow baking pan in lower third of oven, shaking pan occasionally, until pale golden, 4 to 5 minutes. Cool, then coarsely chop. Pour chive oil through a fine-mesh sieve into a small bowl, pressing on and then discarding solids. Stir in pine nuts and remaining 2 tablespoons chives. Whisk together mascarpone, cream cheese, and remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt in a bowl until smooth. Fold in chive oil with pine nuts until cream is streaked (do not mix in thoroughly). Transfer dip to a shallow bowl and serve with toasts.",
