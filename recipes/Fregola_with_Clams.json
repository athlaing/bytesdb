            "Kosher salt",
            "1/2 cup olive oil, plus more for drizzling",
            "2 garlic cloves, finely chopped",

            "Cook fregola in a large pot of boiling salted water, stirring occasionally, until very al dente, 6\u20138 minutes; drain.",
            "Meanwhile, heat 1/2 cup oil in a Dutch oven or other large heavy pot over medium-high heat. Add garlic and red pepper flakes and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Carefully add wine; bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer until reduced by half, about 3 minutes.",
            "Add clams, cover, and cook, transferring clams to a bowl as they open (discard any that do not open), 6\u20138 minutes. Add fregola to cooking liquid in pot and cook, stirring, until fregola is tender and sauce is slightly thickened (there should still be plenty of liquid), about 2 minutes. Return clams to pot and cook until warmed through.",
