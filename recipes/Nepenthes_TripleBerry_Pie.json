            "Nepenthe Pie Dough",
            "3 cups fresh strawberries",
            "3 cups fresh blackberries",
            "3 cups fresh raspberries",
            "2 tablespoons Grand Marnier",
            "1/2 cup firmly packed brown sugar",
            "1/4 cup cornstarch",
            "1 1/2 teaspoons cinnamon",
            "2/3 cup flour",
            "2/3 cup whole oats",
            "2/3 cup firmly packed brown sugar",
            "2/3 cup walnuts",
            "1/2 cup (1 stick) cold butter"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "On a lightly floured board, roll out the dough (it may need to soften for 5 or 10 minutes first) into a 12-inch circle. Fit into a 9-inch pie pan, trim any ends hanging over the side, and flute the edge with your thumb. Chill until ready to use.",
            "Preheat the oven to 350\u00b0F.",
            "For the filling, wash and hull the strawberries. Cut them in half and place in a large bowl. Add the blackberries and raspberries and toss with the Grand Marnier. In a separate bowl, combine the brown sugar, cornstarch, and cinnamon. Add to the berries and gently toss.",
            "For the topping, combine the flour, oats, brown sugar, walnuts, and butter in the bowl of a food processor. Pulse until the mixture resembles small peas. To make by hand, cut the butter into the flour and sugar, using a pastry cutter. Finely chop the walnuts and add in along with the oats.",
            "Fill the chilled pie shell with the filling and cover thoroughly with the topping. Bake for 1 hour, until bubbling and golden brown on top."
