            "1 large onion, diced",

            "3 garlic cloves, minced",

        "instructions": [
            "Roast the poblano and jalape\u00f1o chiles over an open flame on your stove, or under your broiler, until their skins are blistered and charred all over, about 10 minutes. Transfer them to a bowl, cover with a plate, and let them sit until they are cool enough to handle. Then rub the skins off with a paper towel, and seed and dice the chiles.",
            "Using the saut\u00e9 function, heat 2 tablespoons of the oil in the pressure cooker. Stir in the onion and cook until golden, about 15 minutes. Stir in the sage, two-thirds of the minced garlic, and the chili powder and cumin; cook for 1 minute. Stir in the chopped poblanos, half the jalape\u00f1os, and the beans, salt, and 5 cups of water. Cover, and cook on high pressure for 40 minutes. Allow the pressure to release naturally. If the beans aren\u2019t cooked through, cook on high pressure for 5 minutes, then manually release pressure.",
            "While the beans are cooking, in a blender combine the tomato, cilantro stems, half the cilantro leaves, the scallion whites, the remaining garlic, the remaining 3 tablespoons oil, the remaining jalape\u00f1os, and a large pinch of salt. Blend to puree; then taste and add more salt and pepper if necessary.",
            "When the beans finish cooking, stir in the tomato puree; let sit for 5 minutes. Then, if the mix seems thin, simmer it on the saut\u00e9 setting for a few minutes to thicken it up.",
            "Transfer the beans to individual serving bowls, and top with the cheese if using, the remaining cilantro leaves, and thinly sliced scallion greens. Serve with lime wedges on the side.",
            "Slow Cooker Variation: Cook on high for 6 to 7 hours or on low for 8 to 10 hours. Add the tomato puree during the last 20 minutes.",
