            "Combine both flours and salt in processor. Add butter; cut in, using on/off turns, until mixture resembles coarse meal. Add 2 tablespoons water; process until moist clumps form, using on/off turns. If dough is dry, add more water by teaspoonfuls to moisten. Gather dough into ball. Flatten into disk. Wrap in plastic; chill 1 hour. (Can be made 3 days ahead. Keep chilled. Let stand at room temperature to soften slightly before rolling.)",
            "Preheat oven to 400\u00b0F. Roll out dough on floured surface to 14-inch round. Transfer to 10-inch tart pan with removable bottom. Trim to fit. Line crust with foil. Fill with dried beans or pie weights. Bake 15 minutes. Remove foil and beans; bake until golden, about 10 minutes. Cool completely on rack. Maintain oven temperature.",
            "Make filling: Using electric mixer, beat egg whites and salt in large bowl until frothy. Gradually beat in 3/4 cup sugar and lemon. Beat until stiff but not dry. Mix cranberries, almonds, cornstarch and cinnamon in medium bowl; gently fold into whites in 3 additions. Transfer filling to crust. Smooth top. Bake tart until tester inserted into center comes out clean, about 30 minutes. Cool on rack. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Cover; store at room temperature.) Sift powdered sugar over tart. Cut into wedges and serve.",
