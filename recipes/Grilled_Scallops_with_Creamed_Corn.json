            "Prepare a grill for medium-high heat. Coarsely grind pasilla chiles in spice mill. Mix ground chiles with thyme, oregano, coriander, fennel, chipotle chile powder, black pepper, paprika, garlic powder, and onion powder in a small bowl to combine. Scatter lime zest over scallops, then cover them all over with 2 Tbsp. dry rub (reserve extra rub for another use). Chill scallops while you make the creamed corn.",
            "Heat olive oil in a medium saucepan over medium-low. Cook green garlic, shallot, and garlic, stirring occasionally, until very tender but without taking on any color, 6\u20138 minutes. Increase heat to medium and add grated corn; cook, stirring often, until liquid evaporates, about 5 minutes. Stir in 2 Tbsp. water and cook, stirring, until absorbed. Continue to cook, stirring and adding water 2 Tbsp. at a time and letting it absorb completely before adding more, until corn is creamy with a risotto-like consistency, 12\u201318 minutes. Stir in butter; season creamed corn with salt.",
            "Thread scallops onto skewers, dividing evenly, season with salt, and drizzle with a little vegetable oil. Grill until deeply browned and just cooked through, about 3 minutes per side, depending on size. Transfer skewers to a platter and squeeze some lime juice over scallops.",
            "To serve, divide creamed corn among plates and top with skewers. Serve with more lime wedges for squeezing over.",
            "Do Ahead: Dry rub can be made 1 month ahead. Store airtight at room temperature.",
