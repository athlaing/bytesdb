Gently press strawberries with potato masher to help release their juices, being careful not to crush them to a pulp. Let stand at room temperature, stirring occasionally, 45 minutes to 1 hour. Beat together heavy cream, sour cream, confectioners sugar (to taste), and vanilla in a bowl with an electric mixer at medium-high speed until it holds a soft shape (not stiff). Split biscuits horizontally with a fork and arrange 2 halves, split sides up, on each of 6 plates. Top with strawberries and juices, then with whipped cream.",
