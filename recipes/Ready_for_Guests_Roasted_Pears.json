        "title": "Ready for Guests Roasted Pears ",
        "ingredients": [
            "Butter-flavored cooking spray",
            "2 firm pears (about 6 ounces each), rinsed",
            "2 teaspoons light butter, melted (stick, not tub; I used Challenge Light)",
            "2 tablespoons brown sugar, not packed",
            "2 pinches cinnamon"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Preheat the oven to 350\u00b0F. Line an 8- x 8-inch baking dish with parchment. Lightly mist the parchment with spray. Crinkle a piece of foil to form a log about 12 inches long, 4 inches wide, and 1 inch in diameter. Set the log in the center of the baking dish. Cut the pears in half lengthwise. Carefully scoop out the cores and remove the stems. Place the halves on the prepared baking sheet so the tips rest on the log (this is to ensure the pears lay flat so the glaze doesn't drip out during baking). Drizzle the butter evenly over the pears. Then sprinkle the brown sugar, followed by the cinnamon, evenly over the top. Bake for 40 to 45 minutes, or until very tender. Allow the pears to cool until they're just warm or room temperature, about 15 minutes. Serve immediately."
