            "1 1/2 to 2 tablespoons chopped fresh tarragon",
            "1/2 teaspoon Dijon mustard",
            "1/2 teaspoon salt",
            "1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil",
            "2 cups grape or cherry tomatoes, halved",

        "instructions": [
            "Prepare lobster, potatoes, and corn: Plunge 2 live lobsters headfirst into an 8-quart pot of boiling salted water. Cover and cook lobsters over moderately high heat 9 minutes from time they enter water, then transfer with tongs to sink to cool. Return water to a boil and cook remaining 2 lobsters in same manner. Leave water boiling in pot. Simmer potatoes in lobster cooking water until just tender, 15 to 20 minutes. Transfer with a slotted spoon to a colander, reserving boiling water in pot. Boil corn in same water until crisp-tender, about 3 minutes, then drain. When lobsters are cool, remove meat from claws, joints, and tails, reserving shells for another use. Cut meat into 1-inch pieces. Cut potatoes into 3/4-inch pieces, and cut corn from cobs.",
