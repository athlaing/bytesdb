            "In a large bowl, whisk together the eggs, milk, and kosher salt; set aside. Heat 1 tablespoon of the olive oil in a saut\u00e9 pan over medium heat. Add the green onion and garlic and saut\u00e9 until soft, 1 to 2 minutes. Add the greens, grains, and remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil and saut\u00e9 until the greens are wilted and the grains are warmed through, 3 to 5 minutes.",
            "Decrease the heat to low and pour in the egg mixture, gently stirring to comingle them with the greens and grains. Continue stirring until they're softly scrambled, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from the heat, stir in the chives, and season with pepper.",
            "Serve hot with a sprinkling of flaky salt on top, and crusty bread, toasted English muffins, or warm corn tortillas alongside."
