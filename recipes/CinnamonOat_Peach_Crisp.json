        "ingredients": [
            "5 lb. medium peaches (about 12), peeled, sliced 1/2\" thick",
            "2/3 cup granulated sugar",
            "2 Tbsp. plus 1 cup all-purpose flour",
            "2 cups old-fashioned oats",
            "2/3 cup (packed) light brown sugar",
            "4 tsp. ground cinnamon",
            "1 tsp. kosher salt",
            "1 cup (2 sticks) chilled unsalted butter, cut into small pieces",
            "2 pints vanilla ice cream"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Toss peaches, granulated sugar, and 2 Tbsp. flour in a large bowl to combine. Let sit, tossing occasionally, 30 minutes.",
            "Place a rack in center of oven; preheat to 350\u00b0F.",
            "Meanwhile, whisk oats, brown sugar, cinnamon, salt, and remaining 1 cup flour in a large bowl to combine. Using an electric mixer on low speed, gradually add butter. Once it has all been added, increase speed to medium-high and beat until dry ingredients are incorporated (there should be no dry bits left in the bowl), about 3 minutes.",
