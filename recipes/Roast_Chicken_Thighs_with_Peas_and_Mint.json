        "ingredients": [
            "6 skin-on, bone-in chicken thighs (about 2 1/2 lb. total)",
            "1 Tbsp. ground coriander",
            "Kosher salt",
            "2 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil",
            "3 large leeks, white and pale green parts only, sliced 1/2\" thick",
            "4 garlic cloves, thinly sliced",
            "5 (2x1\") strips lemon zest",
            "2 bay leaves",
            "1/3 cup dry white wine",
            "1 1/2 cups low-sodium chicken broth",

        "instructions": [
            "Preheat oven to 350\u00b0F. Pat chicken thighs dry; sprinkle flesh side with coriander. Season generously all over with salt.",
            "Heat oil in a large high-sided or cast-iron skillet over medium. Cook chicken, skin side down, undisturbed, until thighs release easily from pan, about 4 minutes. Continue to cook, scooting chicken around occasionally for even browning, until golden brown, about 5 minutes more. Transfer chicken to a plate.",
            "Pour out all but 2 Tbsp. fat from skillet and return to medium heat. Add leeks and garlic and cook, stirring occasionally, until slightly softened, about 3 minutes. Add lemon zest and bay leaves and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 20 seconds. Pour in wine, scraping up any brown bits stuck to bottom of pan with a wooden spoon. Cook until wine is almost completely evaporated, about 3 minutes. Add broth and bring to a simmer. Return chicken to skillet, arranging skin side up. Transfer skillet to oven; roast chicken until cooked through and juices run clear when poked with a paring knife, 15\u201320 minutes. Transfer chicken to a plate.",
            "If using fresh peas, cook in same skillet over medium heat until tender and bright green, about 3 minutes. If using frozen, cook just until warmed through, about 1 minute. Toss in mint; season with more salt if needed. Arrange vegetables and chicken in a large shallow bowl or on a platter."
