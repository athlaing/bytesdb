Toss with chicken and let marinate 20 to 30 minutes. For the salsa, combine mangoes, scallions, serrano pepper, cilantro, lime juice, and salt. Let sit 20 to 30 minutes. For the salad, whisk together remaining 1 tbsp lemon juice, olive oil, and salt and pepper to taste, then toss dressing with watercress. To cook chicken, coat a large skillet with cooking spray and set over medium-high heat. Add chicken in a single layer and cook 3 to 4 minutes on each side until browned and cooked through. To assemble the plates, place 1/4 watercress salad on each plate, then mound 1/4 salsa in the center and arrange chicken strips on top."
