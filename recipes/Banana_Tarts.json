            "1 sheet (about 1/2 pound) frozen puff pastry, thawed",
            "2 bananas, cut diagonally into 1/4-inch-thick slices",
            "1 1/2 tablespoons sugar",
            "1/4 teaspoon cinnamon",
            "1 1/2 tablespoons cold unsalted butter, cut into bits",
            "3 tablespoons orange marmalade"

        "instructions": [
            "Roll out the pastry 1/8 inch thick on a lightly floured surface, cut out two 6-inch rounds, and transfer them to a baking sheet. Arrange the banana slices, overlapping them slightly, on the rounds, covering the rounds completely. In a small bowl stir together the sugar and the cinnamon and sprinkle the mixture evenly over the bananas. Dot the bananas evenly with the butter and bake them in the middle of a preheated 400\u00b0F. oven for 25 to 30 minutes, or until the pastry is golden brown. While the tarts are baking, in a small saucepan bring the marmalade to a boil with 1 teaspoon water, stirring, and strain it through a fine sieve into a small bowl. Transfer the tarts to a rack, brush them with the strained marmalade, and let them cool to warm.",
