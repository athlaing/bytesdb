            "Rinse the cranberries and place in a medium bowl. Heat the syrup in a small saucepan until just warm. Pour over the cranberries. (Make sure the syrup is warm, not hot, or the cranberries may pop.) Gently stir with a spoon to coat all the berries. Cool, cover, and let soak in the refrigerator overnight.",
            "The next day drain the cranberries in a colander. Place the sugar in a large bowl or baking dish. Add half of the cranberries and roll them around until lightly coated in sugar; repeat with the other half. Place on a baking sheet and let dry, about 1 hour.",
            "To assemble, top the crackers with one slice of Brie, a light layer of cranberry chutney, and four or five sugared cranberries. Garnish with fresh mint sprigs."
