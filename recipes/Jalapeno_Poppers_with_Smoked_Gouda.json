        "title": "Jalape\u00f1o Poppers with Smoked Gouda ",
        "ingredients": [
            "12 large jalape\u00f1o chiles",
            "4 ounces cream cheese",
            "1 cup finely shredded smoked Gouda",
            "Salt",
            "Chopped fresh cilantro for serving"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Start the coals or heat a gas grill for medium direct cooking. Make sure the grates are clean.",
            "Cut the jalape\u00f1os in half lengthwise but leave the halves connected at the stem. With your finger or a pointed spoon (like a grapefruit spoon), remove the seeds and white ribs from the halves. (Wear rubber gloves, or be careful not to touch your skin after handling the chiles.)",
            "Put the cream cheese and Gouda in a medium bowl with a little salt; mash until combined. Fill the jalape\u00f1o halves evenly with a small spoon and press the halves back together to close. (You can fill and refrigerate the jalape\u00f1os up to a day ahead.)",
            "Put the jalape\u00f1os on the grill directly over the fire. Close the lid and cook, carefully turning once, until the peppers have softened and browned (it\u2019s okay if they char in spots) and the cheese has melted, 5 to 10 minutes. Transfer to a platter, sprinkle with cilantro, and serve.",
            "Variations: Honey-Orange Jalape\u00f1o Poppers: In Step 3, fill the jalape\u00f1os with a mixture of 1 1/2 cups crumbled fresh goat cheese (6 ounces), 2 tablespoons honey, 1 tablespoon grated orange zest, and salt to taste. Jalape\u00f1o Poppers with Pimento Cheese and Pepper Jelly: In Step 3, fill the jalape\u00f1os with with a mixture of 1 cup grated extra-sharp cheddar cheese (4 ounces), 1/4 cup each chopped drained pimentos and mayonnaise, and a dash of Worcestershire sauce. Serve topped with a dab of pepper jelly. Pesto Jalape\u00f1o Poppers with Mozzarella: In Step 3, fill the jalape\u00f1os with a mixture of 1 1/2 cups shredded mozzarella (6ounces) and 1/4 cup basil pesto. Serve the poppers topped with fresh basil leaves if you like.",
