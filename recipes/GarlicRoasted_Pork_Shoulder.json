        "title": "Garlic-Roasted Pork Shoulder ",
        "ingredients": [
            "1 head garlic, cloves peeled",
            "2 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon kosher salt, divided",
            "1 1/2 tablespoons dried oregano",
            "2 tablespoons distilled white vinegar",
            "2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice",
            "1 (7- to 7 1/2-pound) bone-in pork shoulder with skin",
            "Accompaniment: lime wedges"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Mash garlic to a paste with 2 tablespoons kosher salt using a mortar and pestle or side of a large heavy knife, then stir in oregano, vinegar, lemon juice, and 1 tablespoon pepper.",
            "Pat pork dry. Using a small sharp knife, cut a wide pocket at large end of roast to separate skin from fat, leaving skin attached at sides and stopping before roast narrows to bone.",
            "Make 1-inch-deep slits in pork under skin and on all meaty sides, twisting knife slightly to widen openings, then push some of garlic mixture into slits with your fingers. Rub any remaining garlic mixture over roast (not skin). Wipe skin clean, then rub with remaining teaspoon kosher salt (to help it crisp). Transfer pork to a glass or ceramic shallow dish and marinate, covered and chilled, at least 8 hours.",
            "Put pork, skin side up, in a flameproof roasting pan, discarding marinade, and bring to room temperature, about 1 hour.",
            "Meanwhile, preheat oven to 350\u00b0F with rack in middle.",
            "Cover pork with parchment paper and then tightly with foil and roast 2 1/2 hours. Discard foil and parchment, then add 1/2 cup water to pan and roast, uncovered, adding more water when liquid in pan evaporates (check about every half hour), until skin is browned and crisp and meat is fork-tender, 2 to 2 1/2 hours more. Transfer to a cutting board or platter, reserving juices in pan, and let stand 30 minutes.",
            "Meanwhile, pour pan juices through a sieve into a fat separator or bowl and discard fat. Add 3/4 cup water to roasting pan and deglaze by boiling over medium-high heat (straddle 2 burners if necessary), scraping up brown bits, 1 minute, then add to pan juices along with enough water to bring total to 1 1/2 cups.",
            "Cut skin off roast pork. (If skin is not crisp, roast in a shallow baking pan in a 475\u00b0F oven until crisp, about 10 minutes.) Cut skin into serving pieces. Pull meat from roast in pieces using a fork. Serve meat with pan juices and pork skin."
