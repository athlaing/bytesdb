Cook 2 minutes longer. Add vinegar mixture to corn mixture; simmer 5 minutes. Cool to room temperature in fridge. Stir in chives.",
            "For pan-roasted sirloin: Season steaks with salt and pepper. Sprinkle oil on a nonstick skillet, then wipe it clean. Heat skillet, then add steaks and cook on medium-high heat for 3 minutes until brown on one side; turn steaks and cook 3 minutes more. Add fresh herbs to pan. Continue cooking steaks, turning from side to side, until done (13 to 15 minutes total for medium rare). Remove steaks from skillet and set aside to rest for 10 minutes. Slice and serve with room-temperature corn relish on top.",
