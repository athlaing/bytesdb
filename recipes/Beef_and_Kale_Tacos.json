            "Preheat the oven to 300\u00b0F.",
            "Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the olive oil, then add the beef, carrots, and garlic. Sprinkle with the salt. Cook for 4 to 5 minutes, stirring occasionally, until meat begins to brown and the vegetables soften. Add the chili powder, cumin, and tomato paste. Cook for an additional 1 to 2 minutes, until the spices become fragrant. Add the water, reduce the heat, and simmer for 4 to 5 minutes, until the beef is no longer pink in the center.",
            "Meanwhile, place the taco shells in the oven for 5 to 10 minutes to warm them (or warm them in the toaster oven). Assemble each taco by spooning in 2 tablespoons of the meat and some of the kale and cheese into each shell. Top each taco with 1 teaspoon salsa and serve immediately."
