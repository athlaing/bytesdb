            "Rinse the dried mushrooms well under cold running water to remove dirt. Place in a small bowl along with 1 cup of boiling water. Allow to rest for 15 minutes, then drain, reserving 1/2 cup of the liquid.",
            "Heat a large stockpot over medium heat. Add the truffle oil or olive oil, flour, salt, and black pepper. Cook 1 to 2 minutes, stirring often, until a thick paste forms. Reduce the heat to low, add half of the milk, and whisk well to create a soft paste. Whisk in the remaining milk and reserved mushroom liquid. Add the shiitakes and cook 2 to 3 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the mushrooms are soft and a thick mixture forms.",
            "Add the Fontina, Parmesan, and goat cheese. Stir together well and cook 1 minute, until the cheese melts. Add the artichokes and cooked pasta. Stir well to coat. Serve immediately with the broccoli on the side."
