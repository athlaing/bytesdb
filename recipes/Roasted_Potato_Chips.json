            "2 pounds large boiling potatoes (about 4)",
            "1 teaspoon salt",
            "1/2 teaspoon sugar",
            "3 1/2 tablespoons olive oil",

        "instructions": [
            "Put oven rack in lower third of oven and preheat oven to 450\u00b0F. Peel potatoes, then cut each lengthwise into 6 wedges and toss with salt, sugar, and 3 tablespoons oil in a large bowl. Transfer to a 17- by 11-inch shallow baking pan (about 1 inch deep) and spread potatoes in 1 layer. Roast potatoes 15 minutes, then loosen with a metal spatula and turn over onto other sides, arranging pale potatoes around outer edges of pan and golden potatoes in center (for even roasting). Roast 15 minutes, then loosen and turn with spatula again. Quickly toss garlic with remaining 1/2 tablespoon oil and sprinkle around potatoes in pan. Roast until potatoes are tender and golden brown and garlic is pale golden, about 10 minutes more. Loosen potatoes and garlic with spatula. Cool slightly before serving.",
