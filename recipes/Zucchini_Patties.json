        "instructions": [
            "Mix zucchini, onion, and 1 tablespoons salt in a medium bowl. Let sit 10 minutes, then wring out as much liquid as possible from zucchini and onion in a kitchen towel. Mix with leek, egg, panko, cilantro, and thyme in a clean medium bowl; season with pepper. Pour oil into a large skillet, preferably cast iron, to a depth of 1/2\" and heat over medium heat until oil bubbles when a pinch of zucchini mixture is added. Working in batches, drop spoonfuls of zucchini mixture into skillet and gently flatten with a spatula into 2\" patties. Cook until golden brown, about 3 minutes per side. Drain on paper towels; season with salt. Serve with Roasted Red Pepper Labneh. Do ahead: Patties can be made 30 minutes ahead. Keep warm in a 300 \u00b0 oven until ready to serve.",
