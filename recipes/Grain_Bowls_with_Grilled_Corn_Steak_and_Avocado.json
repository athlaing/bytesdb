            "Season steak with 1 tsp. salt and 1 tsp. pepper. Let sit at room temperature 30 minutes.",
            "Prepare a grill for medium-high heat or heat grill pan over medium-high. Grill steak, turning occasionally, until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of steak registers 120\u2013125\u00b0F for medium-rare (2\u20133 minutes per side for skirt; 3\u20134 minutes per side for flank). Transfer to a cutting board and let rest at least 10 minutes or until cool.",

            "Do Ahead: Steak and corn can be grilled 3 days ahead. Transfer to separate airtight containers and chill."
