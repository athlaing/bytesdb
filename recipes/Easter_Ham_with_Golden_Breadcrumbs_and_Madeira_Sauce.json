        "title": "Easter Ham with Golden Breadcrumbs and Madeira Sauce ",
        "ingredients": [
            "1 16-pound whole bone-in smoked ham",
            "2 cups (packed) dark brown sugar",
            "1/2 cup Dijon mustard",
            "1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil",
            "3 cups coarse fresh breadcrumbs made from six 1/2\"-thick slices rustic white bread",
            "3 cups Madeira",
            "Cheesecloth"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Arrange a rack on lowest level of oven; preheat to 300\u00b0F. Without trimming fat, remove outer rind from most of ham, leaving a band around end of shank bone. Spacing cuts 3/4\" apart to make a diamond pattern, score fat on top of ham crosswise and then lengthwise on a diagonal (do not cut into meat). Place ham in a large roasting pan. Pour 3 cups water into pan and roast ham for 2 hours.",
            "Meanwhile, stir brown sugar and mustard in a medium bowl until a thick paste forms; set aside. Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add breadcrumbs; toast, stirring often, until very crispy, 5-7 minutes. Set aside.",
            "Remove ham from oven; increase temperature to 350\u00b0F. Spread half of sugar-mustard paste over scored top of ham. Bake until an instant-read thermometer inserted into thickest part of ham registers 145\u00b0F, about 1 hour. If pan juices have dried out, add 1 cup water to pan.",
            "Remove ham from oven; increase temperature to 400\u00b0F. Spread remaining sugar-mustard paste over ham and pack breadcrumbs all over top.",
            "Bake ham until crumbs are deep golden brown and crisp, 12-15 minutes. Transfer ham to a serving platter; let rest for 20 minutes before carving.",
            "Line a fine-mesh sieve with cheesecloth. Set sieve over a medium pitcher or gravy boat. Spoon off fat from surface of juices in pan; discard. Add Madeira to pan. Place roasting pan over medium-high heat and simmer liquids briskly, scraping up browned bits, until sauce thickens and is reduced to 2 cups, about 15 minutes. Strain sauce through prepared sieve, pressing on solids; discard solids.",
            "Carve ham. Serve sauce alongside."
