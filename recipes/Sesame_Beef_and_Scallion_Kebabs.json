        "ingredients": [
            "1/4 cup soy sauce",
            "2 garlic cloves, forced through a garlic press",
            "1 tablespoon Asian (toasted) sesame oil",
            "1 teaspoon minced fresh gingerroot",
            "1 1/2 tablespoons sugar",
            "2 teaspoons wine vinegar",
            "2 teaspoons sesame seeds",
            "1 teaspoon black pepper",
            "3/4 pound boneless shell steak, cut into 1-inch cubes",
            "five 7-inch bamboo skewers",
            "8 scallions, trimmed"

        "instructions": [
            "In a small bowl whisk together the soy sauce, the garlic, the oil, the gingerroot, the sugar, the vinegar, the sesame seeds, and the pepper. Thread the steak cubes loosely onto 4 of the skewers and thread the remaining skewer crosswise through the middle of each scallion so that the scallions stand parallel to one another. Put the beef and scallion kebabs in a shallow dish just large enough to hold them, pour the marinade over them, coating them well, and let the kebabs marinate, chilled, turning them frequently, for 25 minutes. Grill the kebabs on an oiled rack set about 6 inches over glowing coals, turning them, for 10 minutes. Alternatively the kebabs may be broiled under a preheated broiler about 4 inches from the heat in the same manner.) Divide the beef and the scallions, both removed from the skewer, between 2 plates.",
