        "ingredients": [
            "3/4 cup (1 1/2 sticks) unsalted butter, room temperature",
            "16 1/4\"-thick slices assorted bread",
            "Assorted fixings",
            "1 1/2 pounds assorted cheeses, coarsely grated",
            "Kosher salt, freshly ground pepper"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Arrange racks in upper and lower thirds of oven; preheat to 350\u00b0F. Set a wire rack inside each of 2 foil-lined rimmed baking sheets. Butter 1 side of each bread slice with about 1/2 tablespoon. butter.",
            "Heat a medium skillet over medium heat until very hot, at least 2 minutes. Melt 1/2 tablespoon butter in skillet. Add 2 slices of bread, buttered side down; cook, pressing down often with a spatula to ensure even toasting and rotating pan frequently, until bread is evenly golden brown, 3\u00f14 minutes. (Do not rush or increase heat, or your bread will burn before it can evenly toast.)",
            "Transfer bread slices, toasted side down, to prepared wire racks (this will help keep bread crunchy). Repeat with remaining bread and butter, wiping out skillet between batches. (If all of the bread doesn't fit on the racks, you may need to bake sandwiches in two batches.) DO AHEAD: Bread can be toasted 1 hour ahead; let stand at room temperature.",
            "Garnish untoasted side of each slice of bread with fixings, then top each slice with a small handful of cheese (about 1 1/2 ounces), scattering evenly. Season with salt and pepper (do not skip this step; it really elevates the flavors in the sandwich).",
            "Bake bread slices, rotating baking sheets halfway through, until cheese is thoroughly melted, 10\u00f112 minutes (begin checking after 8 minutes; some cheeses melt faster than others). Working in batches, firmly press 2 cheese-topped sides of sandwiches together. Let rest for 1-2 minutes. Slice in half or into quarters. Serve hot or warm."
