            "Beat egg whites in a large bowl with an electric mixer at high speed until they just hold soft peaks, then add granulated sugar, 1 tablespoon at a time, beating, and continue to beat until whites hold stiff, glossy peaks, 3 to 4 minutes in a stand mixer or 4 to 6 with a handheld. Add yolks and vanilla and beat until very thick, about 2 minutes.",

Lightly dust top with confectioners sugar. Invert pan onto kitchen towel, then remove pan and peel off parchment. Cool cake completely, about 15 minutes.",
            "Make pastry cream while cake bakes and cools: Whisk together cornstarch and milk in a 1-quart heavy saucepan until smooth. Bring to a boil over moderate heat, whisking constantly, then boil, whisking constantly, 1 minute. Whisk milk mixture gradually into egg yolk in a small bowl. Return mixture to saucepan and cook over moderate heat, whisking constantly, 1 minute.
