            "In a large bowl whisk together 5 1/2 cups flour, salt, and pepper. Make a well in center and add yeast mixture, 2 tablespoons oil, fennel seeds, and liqueur. Using a wooden spoon first and then your hands, blend in liquid until a dough is formed.",
            "On a lightly floured surface knead dough, adding flour if dough is sticky, 10 minutes, or until smooth and satiny. Put dough in a large bowl and let rise, loosely covered, in a warm place 1 hour, or until doubled in bulk.",
