        "ingredients": [
            "4 pounds leg of veal, boned and cut in 2\" cubes",
            "6 small onions, thinly sliced",
            "6 tablespoons butter",
            "Flour seasoned with salt and pepper",
            "Red wine (Beaujolais)",
            "7-8 shallots, finely chopped",
            "3 cloves garlic, finely chopped",
            "1 tablespoon fresh (or 1 teaspoon dried) basil",
            "Garnish: finely chopped parsley"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Saut\u00e9 onions in butter until just wilted. Roll meat cubes in seasoned flour and add to pan. Saut\u00e9 the veal, turning to brown on all sides. When browned, add enough red wine to just cover the shallots, garlic, and basil. Cover and cook gently in a 325\u00b0F oven for 2 1/2 to 3 hours, or until veal is tender. Remove meat to a hot platter and pour sauce over it (you may return it to the top of the stove and stir in beurre mani\u00e9 if you want a thicker sauce). Garnish with chopped parsley and serve with boiled new potatoes and chopped cooked spinach flavored with garlic, olive oil, and lemon juice. With this, drink a fine red Beaujolais."
