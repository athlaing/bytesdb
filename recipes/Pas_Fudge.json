        "ingredients": [
            "4 cups granulated sugar",
            "2/3 cup cocoa",
            "1 1/2 cups whole milk",
            "2 tablespoons corn syrup",
            "1/2 teaspoon salt",
            "6 tablespoons unsalted butter",
            "2 teaspoons vanilla"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Mix sugar, cocoa, milk, corn syrup, and salt in a large, heavy saucepan or Dutch oven. Place over medium heat and stir faithfully until sugar is melted. Bring to boil and cook to soft-ball stage (234\u00b0 Fahrenheit). Stir occasionally to prevent sticking and scorching. Remove from heat and add butter and vanilla. Let cool to 110\u00b0 without stirring. While the fudge is cooling, butter the bottom and sides of an 8-inch square pan. Beat the fudge with a wooden spoon until it becomes very thick and loses its gloss. Quickly pour into the prepared pan. Score while warm into 1-inch squares, then allow to cool thoroughly for several hours or overnight. Cut with a sharp knife when cool, dipping the knife into hot water between cuts if necessary. Store the fudge between layers of waxed paper in a sealed container in a cool place.",
