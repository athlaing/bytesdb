        "title": "Gingery Watermelon Paletas ",
        "ingredients": [
            "4 cups cubed seedless watermelon (from about half a 5-pound watermelon)",
            "1/4 cup plain 2% fat or whole Greek yogurt",
            "1 teaspoon finely grated peeled ginger",
            "Pinch of kosher salt",
            "1/3 cup (or more) sugar",

        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Pur\u00e9e watermelon, yogurt, ginger, salt, 1/3 cup sugar, and 1 tablespoon lime juice in a blender until smooth. Add more sugar and lime juice, if desired. (Pur\u00e9e will taste less sweet once frozen, so err on the sweet side.)",
            "Divide pur\u00e9e among ice-pop molds. Freeze until mixture begins to set around edges of molds, 45-60 minutes. Stir mixture in molds to blend; insert sticks. Freeze until solid, at least 4 hours. Dip molds briefly in hot water to release paletas.",
