            "3/4 cup wasabi peas (about 3 ounces)",
            "4 (8-ounce) salmon fillets with skin (each about 1 inch to 1 1/4 inches thick)",

        "instructions": [
            "Preheat oven to 400\u00b0F. Blend wasabi peas in processor until ground but with some coarsely crushed pieces. Lightly oil rimmed baking sheet. Arrange salmon fillets, skin side down, on prepared baking sheet. Sprinkle fish with salt. Press ground wasabi peas onto tops of salmon fillets to adhere, covering tops completely. Sprinkle grated lime peel over salmon; drizzle with 1 tablespoon oil. Roast salmon just until opaque in center, about 10 minutes.",
            "Meanwhile, heat remaining 1 tablespoon oil in large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add cabbage and sugar snap peas; saut\u00e9 until vegetables are crisp-tender, about 5 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper.",
            "Transfer 1 salmon fillet to each of 4 plates. Drizzle with lime juice. Mound cabbage-snap pea mixture alongside. Garnish with lime wedges and serve."
