            "Cover lentils with cold water by 1 1/2 inches in a 2-quart saucepan and bring to a boil. Simmer, uncovered, until lentils are just tender, 12 to 25 minutes. Drain in a sieve set over a bowl and reserve 1/2 cup cooking liquid.",
            "While lentils are simmering, melt butter in a 2- to 3-quart heavy saucepan over moderately low heat, then stir in onion, garlic, and salt and cook, covered, stirring occasionally, until pale golden, about 10 minutes. Remove lid and cook, uncovered, stirring occasionally, until golden, 5 to 10 minutes more.",
            "Stir in lentils and enough reserved cooking liquid to moisten (1/4 to 1/2 cup) and cook until heated through.",
            "Just before serving, stir in parsley, lemon juice, pepper, and 1 tablespoon oil.",
            "Cook fish while onion finishes cooking: Pat fish dry and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Heat butter and oil in a 10- to 12-inch nonstick skillet over moderately high heat until foam subsides, then saut\u00e9 fish, turning over once, until browned and just cooked through, 6 to 8 minutes total. Serve fish with lentils and drizzle with additional extra-virgin olive oil if desired.",
