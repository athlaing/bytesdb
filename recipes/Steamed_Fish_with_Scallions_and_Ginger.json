        "title": "Steamed Fish with Scallions and Ginger ",
        "ingredients": [
            "2 whole fish (about 2 pounds each, such as black sea bass or wild salmon), scaled, gutted, and scored",
            "1/2 cup sliced scallions (green part only)",
            "2 tablespoons fresh julienned ginger",
            "1/2 cup soy sauce",
            "1/4 cup peanut oil",
            "1 teaspoon sesame oil",
            "1/2 teaspoon sugar"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Position oven racks in upper and lower thirds of oven. Heat oven to 450\u00b0. Place a long piece of aluminum foil on a large, shallow baking sheet (foil should be longer than sheet); repeat with another baking sheet; place 1 whole fish on each sheet. Season each fish on both sides with salt and pepper. Whisk remaining ingredients in a bowl; spoon over each fish. Seal foil loosely around each fish to create a somewhat roomy pocket. Bake 10 minutes per inch of thickness of fish at its thickest part (typically 20 to 25 minutes for a 2-inch-thick fish). Remove foil and serve with juices.",
