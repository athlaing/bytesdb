            "1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, divided",
            "1 medium red onion, halved and thinly sliced",

        "instructions": [
            "Heat oven to 400\u00b0. Heat pizza stone on bottom rack (or use an inverted 11\" x 16\" cookie sheet, not heated). Toss squash with 1 teaspoon oil, 1/8 teaspoon salt and 1/8 teaspoon pepper. On a baking sheet, cook squash until soft and lightly browned, 25 minutes, stirring halfway through; set aside. In a large skillet over medium-high heat, heat remaining 1 tablespoon oil. Cook onion (season with remaining 1/8 teaspoon salt and 1/8 teaspoon pepper), stirring, until light brown, 10 minutes. Add 2 tablespoons water; cook, stirring, until brown, 5 minutes. Remove from heat. Turn oven up to 450\u00b0. Sprinkle flour on a flat surface. Press dough into a 15-inch circle or 10\" x 16\" rectangle. Top with squash, onion, spinach, cheese and thyme. Dust stone or inverted sheet with cornmeal; place pizza on it. Bake until crust is crispy and cheese melts, 10 to 12 minutes."
