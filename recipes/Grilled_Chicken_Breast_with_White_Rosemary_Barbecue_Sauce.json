        "title": "Grilled Chicken Breast with White Rosemary Barbecue Sauce ",
        "ingredients": [
            "2/3 cup mayonnaise",
            "Grated zest of 1/2 lemon",
            "1/4 cup fresh lemon juice",
            "2 teaspoons chopped fresh rosemary",
            "1 large garlic clove, crushed through a press",
            "8 boneless and skinless chicken breast halves (about 6 ounces each), well trimmed of excess fat",
            "1 teaspoon salt",
            "1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "1. To make the sauce, whisk the mayonnaise, lemon zest and juice, rosemary, and garlic together. Transfer to a covered container and refrigerate for up to 3 days. 2. One at a time, place a chicken breast half between two sheets of plastic wrap. Lightly pound with a flat meat mallet or rolling pin until evenly thick (about 1/2 inch). Season the halves with the salt and pepper. Place in a self-sealing plastic bag and refrigerate for up to 1 day. 3. Prepare the grill. Let the fire burn until medium-hot (you can hold your hand just above the cooking grate for about 3 seconds). 4. Lightly oil the cooking grate. Place the chicken on the grill and cook until the undersides are opaque and seared with grill marks, about 4 minutes. Turn, brush with about half of the sauce, and grill until the other side is seared, about 4 minutes longer. Turn, brush with the remaining sauce, and grill, turning occasionally, until the chicken feels firm when pressed, 1 to 2 minutes longer. Transfer to a carving board and let stand for 3 to 5 minutes. Cut into thick slices, transfer to a platter, and serve hot.",
