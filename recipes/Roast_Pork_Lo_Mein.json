Add the garlic, ginger, and scallions and stir-fry until aromatic, about 30 seconds. Add the mushrooms and cook until softened, 1 to 2 minutes.",
            "4. Add the noodles and pork. Pour in the sauce mixture and toss with tongs or chopsticks until the noodles and pork are heated through and well coated with sauce. Transfer to a platter and serve."
