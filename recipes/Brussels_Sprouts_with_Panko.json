        "ingredients": [
            "Corn oil for frying",
            "4 pounds Brussels sprouts, outer leaves removed, cut in half",
            "1 cup Thick Tahini Sauce",
            "1 cup low-fat plain yogurt",
            "2 tablespoons pomegranate molasses",
            "2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil",
            "1/2 teaspoon finely chopped garlic",
            "1 cup panko (Japanese-style breadcrumbs)",
            "Pinch sea salt"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Pour 1/4 to 1/2 inch corn oil in a large skillet and place over a high heat until hot. To test the temperature, slip half a Brussels sprout into the pan; if it makes a popping sound, the oil is hot enough. Working in batches, fry the Brussels sprouts, turning occasionally, until they are browned all over, 2 to 3 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the sprouts to a paper towel-lined plate to drain.",
            "Meanwhile, whisk together the Thick Tahini Sauce , yogurt and pomegranate molasses in a medium bowl. Set aside.",
            "In a small skillet, heat the olive oil over medium-high until hot. Add the garlic and saute until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add the panko and stir constantly until the crumbs are golden brown, about 2 minutes. Stir in the salt and remove the breadcrumbs from the heat. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate to cool.",
            "Place the Brussels sprouts in a serving dish, drizzle with the sauce and top with the panko crumbs. Serve immediately."
