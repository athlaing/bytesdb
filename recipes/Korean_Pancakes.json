Drain mung beans and pur\u00e9e with water in a food processor until smooth, about 1 minute. Add eggs, flour, and salt and blend until smooth, about 30 seconds. Pour mixture over vegetables in bowl and stir with a flexible spatula. (Batter will be thick.) Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large heavy nonstick skillet (at least 8 inches across bottom) over moderate heat until hot but not smoking, then swirl to coat. Stir batter, then ladle 1 cup batter into skillet, pressing down lightly with a large spatula to flatten and evenly distribute vegetables, to make an 8-inch pancake (less than 1/2 inch thick). Cook until edges begin to bubble and turn golden, 1 to 2 minutes, then turn over with spatula and cook until other side is golden, 1 to 2 minutes more. Transfer pancake to paper towels to drain. Make 3 more pancakes in same manner, stacking them (after draining briefly) if desired. Transfer pancakes, 1 at a time, to a cutting board and cut each into 6 wedges. Serve warm or at room temperature with dipping sauce.",
