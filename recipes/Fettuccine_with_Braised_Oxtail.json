Put the oxtails in the hot oil and cook until they are browned on one side, about 5 minutes. Flip them and get some color on the other side, about 5 minutes.

            "Saut\u00e9ing the vegetables Drain the fat from the saut\u00e9 pan. Pour in the remaining 2 tablespoons of canola oil.

            "Making the braising liquid Pour in the wine to deglaze the pan, scraping up the goodness from the bottom. Cook until the wine is reduced by three-quarters of its volume, 7 to 8 minutes. Pour in the chicken stock. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to low and simmer for about 5 minutes. Pour the braising liquid over the oxtail in the Dutch oven. Cover the Dutch oven and slide it into the oven. Braise until the meat starts to fall of the bone, 2 to 2 1/2 hours. Taste a piece of the meat. Do you want more? You're done.",
