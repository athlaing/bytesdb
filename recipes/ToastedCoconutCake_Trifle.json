            "8 ounces American Neufch\u00e2tel or reduced-fat cream cheese, at room temperature",
            "1/3 cup sugar",
            "1/4 cup light coconut milk",
            "1 teaspoon pure coconut extract",
            "3 tablespoons sweetened coconut flakes",
            "4 cups 1/2-inch cubes store-bought angel food cake",
            "Peel of 1 lime, cut into 1/8-inch-wide strips (optional)",
            "1/3 cup plus 2 teaspoons sugar, divided (optional)"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "In a bowl, combine Neufch\u00e2tel, 1/3 cup sugar, milk and coconut extract. Heat oven to 350\u00b0F. Spread coconut evenly on a baking sheet; toast, stirring once or twice, until golden, 5 to 10 minutes. In each of four 8-ounce serving glasses, divide and layer half of coconut cream, half of cake cubes and half of toasted coconut; repeat with remaining cream, cake and coconut. Refrigerate at least 1 hour or up to 24. If garnishing with candied lime: Bring a half-full small pot of water to a boil. Place lime peels in a small mesh sieve; set over pot to submerge peels; boil 2 minutes. Remove sieve and run peels under cold water. Repeat boiling and cooling process with fresh water. Refill same pot with 1/3 cup fresh water and 1/3 cup sugar; bring to a boil. Place sieve over pot so peels are submerged; reduce heat to medium and simmer 5 minutes. Pat peels dry with a paper towel; in a bowl, toss with remaining 2 teaspoons sugar to coat. Top trifles with candied peels; serve."
