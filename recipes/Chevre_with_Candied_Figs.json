        "title": "Ch\u00e8vre with Candied Figs ",
        "ingredients": [
            "3/4 pound ch\u00e8vre or other goat cheese",
            "4 fresh figs or 1/2 cup dried",
            "1/4 cup of balsamic vinegar",
            "3 tbsp of brown muscovado sugar, or brown sugar"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "1. Slice the ch\u00e8vre log, and place on an oven pan. Cut the figs into rounds.",
            "2. Pour the balsamic vinegar and sugar into a small pot, and bring it to a boil. Lower the heat and let it simmer until the mixture is reduced and sticks to the back of a spoon.",
            "3. If you are using dried figs, place them in the vinegar mixture and let them absorb some of the fluid while the mixture cools.",
            "4. Heat the ch\u00e8vre cheese slices quickly by using your oven's broiler function for about 3 minutes, or until the cheese has slightly started to melt. Place the cheese on a serving plate, and top it with the candied figs and vinegar mixture. Serve warm.",
            "Simplify: You can replace muscavado sugar with brown sugar, honey, or regular sugar. Always taste the mixture since the different sugars have different sweetness, and you might have to add more.",

            "For a challenge: With their peppery honey flavor, Black Mission figs are the best money can buy. Fresh Black Mission figs are only available a few weeks out of the year, so if you happen to come across some, make compotes and freeze for later use.",

            "Muscovado sugar: The sugar is available in light and dark flavors, and is a raw sugar made from sugar canes. Compared with regular refined sugar, it is less processed and high in mineral content. The darker sugar has a liquorish flavor, and the lighter version has a toffee flavor.",
