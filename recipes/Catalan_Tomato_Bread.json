        "ingredients": [
            "1 (8-inch) sourdough round or a 20-inch-long sourdough baguette",
            "2 large garlic cloves, halved crosswise",
            "3 to 4 ripe small tomatoes, halved crosswise",
            "3 to 4 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil",
            "Coarse salt to taste"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Prepare grill for cooking. If using a charcoal grill, open vents on bottom of grill, then light charcoal. Charcoal fire is medium-hot when you can hold your hand 5 inches above rack for 3 to 4 seconds. If using a gas grill, preheat burners on high, covered, 10 minutes, then reduce heat to moderate. Cut bread into 3/4-inch-thick slices (cut baguette on a long diagonal for 6-inch-long slices). Working in batches of 3 or 4 slices, grill bread on lightly oiled grill rack, covered only if using a gas grill, turning over once, until grill marks appear, 1 to 2 minutes total per batch. Remove bread from heat and immediately rub 1 side of each slice with cut side of a garlic half, then rub with cut side of a tomato half, using 1 tomato half for 1 to 2 slices of bread and allowing most of pulp to be absorbed by bread (discard remainder of garlic and tomato halves). Brush bread with oil, then sprinkle with salt and serve immediately.",
