        "title": "Sweet Potato Fritters with Poached Eggs and Avocado ",
        "ingredients": [
            "2 small sweet potatoes, peeled and grated",
            "3 free-range eggs",
            "2 tsp coconut oil",
            "1 tsp cider vinegar",
            "1/2 ripe avocado, pit removed",
            "Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Break one egg into a mixing bowl and whisk. Add the sweet potato, one teaspoon of the coconut oil and a good pinch of salt and pepper and mix until completely combined. Using your hands, take a handful of the sweet potato mixture and form six palm-sized balls. Place in a hot frying pan with the remaining coconut oil, flattening gently as they cook to make a patty. Cook until golden then transfer to two plates. Meanwhile, bring a large, wide pan of water with the cider vinegar to the boil. Turn the heat right down so it is very gently simmering and break the remaining eggs into the water to poach. Leave to cook for about 3 minutes before removing with a slotted spoon to drain. Place on top of the sweet potato fritters. Finally, cut the avocado into small chunks and assemble over the eggs and fritters.",
