        "instructions": [
            "Whisk flour and salt in large bowl. Add butter and shortening and rub in with fingertips until pea-size pieces form. Add sour cream and 3 tablespoons ice water. Stir just until dough comes together. Gather dough into ball and divide into 2 pieces. Flatten each into disk. Wrap dough in plastic and refrigerate 2 hours. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Keep refrigerated. Let dough soften slightly at room temperature before continuing.) Preheat oven to 375\u00b0F. Spray 9-inch-diameter glass pie dish with nonstick spray. Roll out 1 dough disk on lightly floured surface to 12- to 13-inch round. Line prepared pie dish with dough. Roll out remaining disk on lightly floured surface to 12- to 13-inch round. Mix raspberries, blueberries, 1 cup sugar, tapioca, and cr\u00e8me de cassis in large bowl. Spoon berry mixture into crust-lined pie dish. Top with second crust, trimming excess dough. Crimp edges together. Cut 3/4-inch hole in center of top crust. Whisk egg and milk in small bowl to blend. Brush some of mixture over crust. Sprinkle with raw sugar. Bake pie 15 minutes; reduce heat to 350\u00b0F. Continue baking until crust browns and juices bubble thickly (cover crust with foil after 30 minutes to prevent overbrowning), about 1 hour. Cool about 2 hours. (Pie can be made 6 hours ahead. Let stand at room temperature.) Cut pie into wedges and serve warm or at room temperature with ice cream.",
