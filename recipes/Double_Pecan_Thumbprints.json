            "2 cups pecan halves",
            "1/3 cup granulated sugar",
            "1 large egg white",
            "2 Tbsp. unsalted butter, room temperature",
            "2 tsp. espresso powder",
            "1/2 tsp. kosher salt",
            "1/4 tsp. almond extract",
            "1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour",
            "1 tsp. kosher salt",
            "1/2 tsp. baking powder",
            "3/4 cup (1 1/2 sticks) unsalted butter, room temperature",
            "1/4 cup granulated sugar",
            "3/4 cup powdered sugar, divided; plus more for serving (optional)",
            "1 large egg yolk",
            "1 tsp. vanilla extract or paste"

        "instructions": [
            "Preheat oven to 350\u00b0F. Lightly toast pecans on a rimmed baking sheet, tossing halfway through, until slightly darkened in color and fragrant, 6\u20138 minutes. Let cool; set 1 1/4 cups pecans aside for making the dough.",
            "Pulse granulated sugar and remaining 3/4 cup pecans in a food processor until nuts are very finely ground (be careful to stop before they become a paste), 30\u201360 seconds. Add egg white and pulse just to blend, then add butter, espresso powder, salt, and almond extract. Pulse just until mixture is smooth and combined. Scrape frangipane into a small bowl and chill at least 30 minutes before using.",
            "Pulse flour, salt, baking powder, and 1 cup reserved pecans in clean food processor until nuts are very finely ground, about 1 minute. Beat butter, granulated sugar, and 1/4 cup powdered sugar in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with paddle attachment on medium-high speed until light and fluffy, about 4 minutes. Add egg yolk and vanilla and beat until combined and no streaks remain. Reduce speed to low and add dry ingredients. Beat just until incorporated, about 1 minute. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and chill dough until it\u2019s firm enough that you can scoop it and it will hold its shape, 30\u201345 minutes. Place racks in upper and lower thirds of oven; preheat to 350\u00b0F. Place 1/2 cup powdered sugar in a shallow bowl. Working in batches, scoop out tablespoonfuls of dough and roll into balls between your hands, then roll in powdered sugar, knocking off any excess. Transfer to 2 parchment-lined baking sheets as you work, spacing 2\" apart. Bake cookies until puffed but edges are still soft, 6\u20138 minutes. Carefully remove from oven and make an indent in the center of each cookie with the handle end of a wooden spoon or a similar heatproof object. Spoon a heaping 1/2-teaspoonful of frangipane into each and top with a pecan half from remaining reserved 1/4 cup. Return cookies to oven and continue to bake until edges are set and very lightly browned, 6\u20138 minutes longer. Let cool on baking sheets. Just before serving, dust cookies with more powdered sugar if desired.",

            "Do Ahead Frangipane can be made 3 days ahead. Cover and keep chilled. You will have more than you need, but try slathering leftovers on toasted brioche and baking until lightly browned (sort of like an almond croissant). We guarantee you won\u2019t be upset about it. Cookies can be baked 5 days ahead. Store airtight at room temperature.",
