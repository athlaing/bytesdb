        "title": "Spaghetti Squash Fritters ",
        "ingredients": [
            "3 cups cooked spaghetti squash, strands separated (from 1 large squash)",
            "1/3 cup arrowroot starch/flour",
            "1/2 teaspoon salt",
            "1 green onion, sliced",
            "4 slices bacon, cooked and crumbled",
            "3 large eggs",
            "1 to 2 tablespoons coconut oil or cooking fat of your choice"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Place the squash in a large bowl. If it\u2019s too moist, wrap it in some paper towels and squeeze out the excess liquid.",
            "Add the arrowroot starch/flour, salt, green onion, and bacon and stir to combine well.",
            "Whisk the eggs in a small bowl, then add them to the squash mixture and stir to combine.",
            "Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Add enough oil to coat the pan, and when it\u2019s hot, spoon the squash mixture to form fritters of your desired size; 1/4 cup per fritter works well.",
            "When the fritters are crispy and browned on one side, about 5 minutes, use a spatula to flip them and continue cooking on the other side until crisped, about 5 minutes longer. Serve hot."
