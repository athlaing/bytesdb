        "ingredients": [
            "1 1/2 lb strawberries, halved (4 1/2 cups)",
            "3/4 cup sugar",
            "17- by 12-inch nonstick bakeware liner such as a Silpat; a large offset spatula"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Pur\u00e9e strawberries with sugar in a blender until smooth, then strain through a fine-mesh sieve into a large heavy saucepan.",
            "Bring pur\u00e9e to a boil, then simmer over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally (more frequently toward end), until thick enough to mound slightly and reduced to 1 to 11/4 cups, 45 minutes to 1 hour.",
            "Preheat oven to 200\u00b0F with rack in middle. Line a large baking sheet with nonstick liner.",
            "Pour hot pur\u00e9e onto liner and spread thinly (as evenly as possible) into a 15- by 10-inch rectangle using spatula. Dry pur\u00e9e in oven until it feels drier (it shouldn't stick to your fingers) but is still slightly tacky, 2 to 3 hours.",
            "Cool on liner on a rack until completely dry, at least 3 hours and up to 24.",
            "Place a sheet of parchment paper over leather, then peel leather off liner and roll up in parchment."
