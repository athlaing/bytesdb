        "ingredients": [
            "4 tablespoons bacon drippings",
            "1 1/2 cups coarse or medium stone-ground cornmeal",
            "1/2 cup all-purpose flour",
            "1 teaspoon kosher salt",
            "1/2 teaspoon baking powder",
            "1/2 teaspoon baking soda",
            "1 large egg, lightly beaten",
            "1 1/2 cups well-shaken buttermilk"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "1 Place the drippings in a 9-inch cast-iron skillet. Place the skillet in the oven as the oven preheats to 450\u00b0F.",
            "2 Whisk together the cornmeal, flour, salt, baking powder, and baking soda in a large bowl. In a small bowl, whisk together the egg and buttermilk, pour into the cornmeal mixture, and stir just until blended.",
            "3 Remove the skillet from the oven and scrape in the batter. It will sizzle and pop, so be careful. Return the skillet to the oven and bake until the cornbread is firm in the middle and golden brown on top, about 25 minutes. Serve hot."
