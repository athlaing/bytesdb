        "ingredients": [
            "3/4 cup shelled natural pistachios (4 ounces)",
            "1 cup all-purpose flour",
            "2 teaspoons baking powder",
            "1 teaspoon ground cardamom",
            "1/4 teaspoon salt",
            "1/2 cup whole milk",
            "1/4 teaspoon vanilla",
            "1 1/2 sticks (3/4 cup) unsalted butter, softened",
            "1 cup sugar",
            "3 large eggs"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Preheat oven to 350\u00b0F. Butter a 13- by 9-inch metal cake pan, then line bottom with wax paper. Butter paper and dust pan with some flour, knocking out excess. Pulse pistachios in a food processor until finely ground (be careful not to overprocess into a paste). Add 1 cup flour, baking powder, cardamom, and salt and pulse once or twice to mix. Combine milk and vanilla in a measuring cup. Beat together butter and sugar in a large bowl with an electric mixer until pale and fluffy. Add eggs 1 at a time, beating well after each addition. Alternately add pistachio flour and milk in batches, beginning and ending with flour, and mix at low speed until just combined. Spread batter evenly in cake pan and bake in middle of oven until a tester comes out clean, about 20 minutes. Cool in pan on a rack 10 minutes, then run a thin knife around sides of cake and invert onto rack. Remove paper and reinvert cake onto a platter. Cut into squares and serve warm or at room temperature.",
