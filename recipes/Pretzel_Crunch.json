        "ingredients": [
            "100 g mini pretzels about 1/4 (16-ounce) bag (2 cups)",
            "60 g light brown sugar 1/4 cup tightly packed",
            "25 g sugar 2 tablespoons",
            "20 g milk powder 1/4 cup",
            "10 g malt powder 1 tablespoon",
            "100 g butter, melted 7 tablespoons"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "1. Heat the oven to 275\u00b0F.",
            "2. Pour the pretzels in a medium bowl and crush them with your hands to one-quarter of their original size. Add the milk powder, malt powder, sugar, and salt and toss to mix. Add the butter and toss to coat. As you toss, the butter will act as glue, binding the dry ingredients to the pretzels and creating small clusters.",
            "3. Spread the clusters on a parchment- or Silpat-lined sheet pan and bake for 20 minutes, at which point they should look toasted, smell buttery, and crunch gently when cooled slightly and chewed.",
            "4. Cool the pretzel crunch completely before storing or using in a recipe. Stored in an airtight container at room temperature, the crunch will keep fresh for 1 week; in the fridge or freezer, it will keep for 1 month."
