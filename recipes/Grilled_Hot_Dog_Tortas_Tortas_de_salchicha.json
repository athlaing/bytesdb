        "title": "Grilled Hot Dog Tortas (Tortas de salchicha) ",
        "ingredients": [
            "About 3 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened",
            "4 large rolls, preferably teleras, Portuguese, kaiser, or ciabatta, split",
            "1/2 cup Refried Black Beans, homemade or canned",
            "8 thin slices yellow American cheese",
            "Scant 1/4 cup Mexican crema or cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche",
            "4 teaspoons Dijon or yellow mustard",
            "6 fully-cooked beef hot dogs (2 ounces each), halved lengthwise"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Heat a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Spread the butter evenly over the cut sides of the rolls. Cook the rolls, buttered sides down, in the skillet until they are light golden brown and crisp, but still soft in the middle, a minute or two.",
            "Spread a layer of beans (a tablespoon or two) over the bottom half of each roll, then put a slice of cheese on the roll bottoms. Spread the crema and mustard over the roll tops and add the remaining cheese.",
            "Cook the hot dogs, cut side down, in the same pan until they're golden brown, about 2 minutes per side. Set the bun bottoms, cheese side down, on top of the hot dogs. Cook for a minute more, so the cheese has a chance to melt.",
            "Flip the bun bottoms and the hot dogs together onto a cutting board. Top with SLICED CANNED PICKLED JALAPE\u00d1OS, THINLY SLICED WHITE ONIONS, slices of RIPE MEXICAN HASS AVOCADO, and a pinch of salt. Cover with the roll tops and press firmly but gently."
