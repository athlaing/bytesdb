        "instructions": [
            "Whisk soy sauce, sugar, oil, red pepper flakes, garlic, ginger, star anise, and 1 cup water in a large bowl until sugar is dissolved. Add short ribs and place a small plate on top of short ribs to keep submerged. Cover bowl and chill at least 8 hours and up to 1 day.",
            "Preheat oven to 325\u00b0F. Transfer marinade and ribs to a large Dutch oven and bring to a simmer over medium heat. Cover and braise in oven, turning meat once, until ribs are very tender but not quite falling off the bone, 1 1/2\u20132 hours.",
            "Transfer ribs to a medium bowl and cover with foil to keep warm. Strain braising liquid into a medium saucepan; discard solids. Let sit a minute or so to settle, then ladle off fat from surface; discard. Bring braising liquid to a boil and cook, whisking occasionally, until reduced by half, 10\u201315 minutes.",
            "Whisk cornstarch and 3 Tbsp. water in a small bowl to make a slurry, then whisk into reduced braising liquid. Cook over medium, whisking constantly, until glaze is thick and bubbling, about 1 minute. Remove from heat and stir in lime juice.",
            "Mound rice in center of shallow bowls and place ribs on top. Drizzle about 2 Tbsp. glaze over each (you\u2019ll have plenty left over; save it and serve with grilled steak or chicken). Top with scallion and sesame seeds. Serve with lime wedges and Sriracha."
