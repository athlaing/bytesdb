            "Char bell peppers directly over gas flame or in broiler until blackened on all sides. Enclose peppers in paper bag and cool completely. Peel, stem, and seed peppers. Cut peppers lengthwise into 1/4-inch-wide strips. With machine running, drop garlic and shallot through processor feed tube and chop coarsely. Add olives, parsley, olive oil, and oregano and chop finely. Season to taste with salt and pepper. (Peppers and olive mixture can be made 1 day ahead. Cover and refrigerate separately. Bring to room temperature before continuing.) Cook pasta in large pot of boiling salted water until tender but still firm to bite, stirring occasionally. Drain well. Return pasta to pot; stir in peppers and olive mixture. Add salami and cheese; toss to combine. Serve warm or let stand at room temperature up to 2 hours.",
