        "title": "Scallop-Stuffed Pickled Peppers ",
        "ingredients": [
            "1 pound sea scallops, sliced horizontally into 1/4 inch rounds and each round halved",
            "2/3 cup fresh lime juice",
            "2 1-pound bottles pepperocini (pickled green mild chili peppers) drained rinsed well under running cold water, and patted dry",
            "red cabbage leaves for lining platters"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "In a ceramic or glass bowl combine the scallops with the lime juice and let them marinate, covered and chilled, stirring several times, for at least 4 hours or overnight (The scallops will \"cook\" in the lime juice.)",
            "Make a lengthwise slit in each pickled pepper, transfer the peppers slit side down to paper towels, and let them drain for 5 minutes. Drain the scallops, reserving the lime juice and stuff a scallop slice curved side up into each pepper. (The stuffed peppers may be prepared up to 4 hours ahead and kept covered and chilled.) Just before serving brush the scallops with the reserved lime juice and arrange the stuffed peppers decoratively on platters lined with the cabbage."
