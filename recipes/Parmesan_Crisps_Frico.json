            "1 (3-oz) piece Parmigiano-Reggiano",
            "1 tablespoon all-purpose flour",
            "1/4 teaspoon black pepper",
            "a nonstick bakeware liner such as a Silpat pad"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Preheat oven to 375\u00b0F.",
            "Using largest holes on a 4-sided grater, coarsely shred enough cheese to measure 1 cup.",
            "Line a large baking sheet with nonstick liner. Stir together cheese, flour, and pepper. Arrange tablespoons of cheese 4 inches apart on liner, stirring cheese in bowl between tablespoons to keep flour evenly distributed. Flatten each mound slightly with a metal spatula to form a 3-inch round.",
            "Bake frico in middle of oven until golden, about 10 minutes. Cool 2 minutes on sheet on a rack, then carefully transfer each crisp (they are very delicate) with metal spatula to rack to cool completely."
