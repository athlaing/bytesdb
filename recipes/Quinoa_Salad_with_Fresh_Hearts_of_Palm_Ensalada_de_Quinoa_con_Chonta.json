            "Wash quinoa in 3 changes of cold water in a bowl, draining in a fine-mesh sieve. Cook quinoa in a medium pot of well-salted boiling water, uncovered, until almost tender, about 10 minutes. Drain in sieve, then set sieve over same pot above 1 inch of simmering water (water should not touch bottom of sieve). Cover quinoa with a folded kitchen towel (not terry cloth), then cover with a lid (don't worry if lid doesn't fit tightly) and steam until tender, fluffy, and dry, about 15 minutes. Let stand off heat, without lid but still covered with towel, 5 minutes. Meanwhile, soak onion in a bowl of cold water 5 minutes, then drain well and pat very dry. Trim ends of hearts of palm, then cut crosswise into very thin slices with slicer. Whisk together vinegar, oil, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper in a large bowl. Toss quinoa, onion, hearts of palm, and parsley with dressing.",
