        "title": "Big-Batch Freezer Pork Tenderloin Strips ",
        "ingredients": [
            "3 lb. pork tenderloins (about 4)",
            "4 tsp. kosher salt",
            "2 tsp. freshly ground black pepper",
            "2 tsp. ground coriander",
            "2 tsp. ground cumin",
            "2 tsp. light brown sugar",
            "Extra-virgin olive oil (for cooking)"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Place pork in a glass or metal baking dish, making sure tenderloins are not touching. Freeze until firm to the touch, 30\u201360 minutes, which will make them easier to slice.",
            "Mix salt, pepper, coriander, cumin, and brown sugar in a small bowl.",
            "Transfer chilled pork to a cutting board. If any tenderloins are extra wide, cut in half lengthwise, then thinly slice all tenderloins crosswise into 1/8\"-thick strips. Transfer to a large bowl. Add spice mixture and toss until coated.",
            "Divide pork among 6 resealable freezer quart bags, patting into an even flat layer in bag and pressing as much air out as possible before sealing. Freeze flat for up to 3 months.",
            "When ready to cook, defrost 1 bag for every 2\u20133 servings. Place bag in a bowl of warm water and let sit until you can press pieces of pork apart in bag but they\u2019re still cold to the touch, about 10 minutes. Heat a swirl of oil in a large skillet over medium-high. Add pork and cook, separating pieces with a wooden spoon or spatula, then stirring often, until browned and just cooked through, 4\u20135 minutes.",
            "If you\u2019re making soup, add frozen pork directly to boiling broth and simmer until cooked through, 5\u20136 minutes."
