        "ingredients": [
            "1 blood or Valencia orange, sliced 1/8\" thick, seeds removed",
            "1 Meyer or regular lemon, sliced 1/8\" thick, seeds removed",
            "4 tablespoons olive oil, divided",
            "Kosher salt, freshly ground pepper",
            "1/4 small red onion, thinly sliced",
            "2 tablespoons fresh Meyer or regular lemon juice",
            "1 bunch watercress or arugula, thick stems trimmed",
            "1/2 cup fresh mint leaves",
            "1 avocado, cut into wedges"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Preheat oven to 425\u00b0. Toss orange and lemon slices with 1 tablespoon oil on a rimmed baking sheet; season with salt and pepper. Roast citrus, tossing occasionally, until lightly charred in spots and starting to caramelize, 10-15 minutes. This makes the citrus flavor more complex. Let cool.",
            "Meanwhile, combine onion and lemon juice in a large bowl; season with salt and pepper and let sit 5 minutes (onion will soften a bit and get slightly sweeter and less harsh).",
            "Add roasted citrus to bowl with onion along with arugula and mint. Drizzle remaining 3 tablespoons oil over; season with salt and pepper and toss everything to combine and coat.",
            "Add avocado and very gently toss until lightly dressed (you don't want to crush the avocado)."
