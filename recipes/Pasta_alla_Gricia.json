        "ingredients": [
            "1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil",
            "6 ounces guanciale (salt-cured pork jowl), cut into 3/4\" pieces",
            "8 ounces rigatoni",
            "Kosher salt",
            "2 teaspoons coarsely ground black pepper, preferably ground with a mortar and pestle",
            "3 ounces Pecorino Romano, finely grated on the small holes of a box grater (about 3 cups)"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Heat oil in a large skillet over mediumlow. Cook guanciale, stirring often, until it starts to brown and crisp, 10\u201315 minutes; it will shrink dramatically as the fat renders. Transfer to a small bowl with a slotted spoon; reserve skillet (do not wipe out).",
            "Meanwhile, cook pasta in a large pot of boiling lightly salted water, stirring occasionally, until pasta is about halfway cooked (not quite al dente); drain, reserving 1 1/2 cups pasta cooking liquid.",
            "Add 3/4 cup pasta cooking liquid to reserved skillet and bring to a gentle boil over medium heat, swirling often to encourage drippings and liquid to emulsify, about 1 minute. Add pasta and cook, tossing often and adding more pasta cooking liquid as needed, until pasta is al dente and a thick, glossy sauce forms, 5\u20137 minutes (this second cooking is why you undercook the pasta initially).",
            "Increase heat to medium-high. Add guanciale, pepper, and two-thirds of Pecorino; toss well to combine and melt cheese. Serve pasta topped with remaining Pecorino."
