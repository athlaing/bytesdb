        "ingredients": [
            "48 mussels (preferably cultivated; about 1 1/2 lb), scrubbed and beards removed",
            "1/4 cup dry white wine",
            "1 hard-boiled large egg",
            "1/2 cup olive oil",
            "3 tablespoons white-wine vinegar",
            "1 medium onion, finely chopped (1/2 cup)",
            "2 teaspoons drained bottled capers, rinsed, chopped if large",
            "1 teaspoon Dijon mustard",
            "1 teaspoon finely chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley",
            "1 teaspoon finely chopped fresh chervil",

        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Cook mussels in wine, covered, in a 5- to 6-quart heavy pot over moderately high heat until mussels just open wide, checking frequently after 4 minutes and transferring open mussels to a shallow baking pan using a slotted spoon. (Discard any mussels that remain unopened after 8 minutes.) When cool enough to handle, detach meat and discard 1 half shell from each mussel. Reserve meat and remaining shells.",
            "Peel and halve egg, then force it through a medium-mesh sieve into a bowl using back of a spoon. Whisk in oil, vinegar, onion, capers, mustard, parsley, chervil, chives, salt, and pepper until sauce is combined well. Add mussels, stirring to coat, then chill mussels in sauce, covered, at least 1 hour.",
            "Arrange half shells on a large platter and spoon a mussel with some sauce into each shell."
