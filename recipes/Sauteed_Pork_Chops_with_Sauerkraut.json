            "While the sauerkraut mixture is the simmering, sprinkle both sides of the chops with salt, let the chops stand between layers of paper towel for 10 minutes, and season them with pepper. In a heavy skillet heat the oil over moderately high heat until it is hot but not smoking and in it saut\u00e9 the chops for 5 to 6 minutes on each side, or until they are just cooked through. Stir 1 tablespoon of the dill into the sauerkraut mixture and transfer the mixture to a heated platter. Top the sauerkraut mixture with the chops and sprinkle the chops with the remaining 1 tablespoon dill."
