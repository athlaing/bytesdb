        "ingredients": [
            "2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour",
            "1 1/2 sticks (3/4 cup) cold unsalted butter, cut into 1/2-inch cubes",
            "1/4 cup cold vegetable shortening (preferably trans-fat-free)",
            "1/2 teaspoon salt",
            "5 to 7 tablespoons ice water",
            "3/4 cup whole almonds (3 ounces), chopped",
            "3/4 cup sugar",
            "4 (6-ounces) containers fresh raspberries (6 cups)",
            "a pastry or bench scraper; an 11 1/4- by 8-inch rectangular tart pan with a removable bottom or a 10-inch round tart pan (1 inch deep) with a removable bottom"

        "instructions": [
            "Make dough: Blend together flour, butter, shortening, and salt in a bowl with your fingertips or a pastry blender (or pulse in a food processor) just until mixture resembles coarse meal with some small (roughly pea-size) butter lumps. Transfer 2 cups mixture to a bowl and drizzle 4 tablespoons ice water evenly over it (reserve remaining mixture). Stir gently with a fork until incorporated. Squeeze a small handful of dough: If it doesn't hold together, add more ice water 1/2 tablespoon at a time, stirring until incorporated. (Do not overwork dough, or pastry will be tough.) Turn out dough onto a work surface and divide into 4 portions. With heel of your hand, smear each portion once or twice in a forward motion to help distribute fat. Gather all dough together with pastry scraper and press into a ball, then flatten into a 5-inch disk. If dough is sticky, dust lightly with additional flour. Wrap disk in plastic wrap and chill until firm, at least 1 hour.",

            "Assemble pie: Put a large baking sheet on oven rack in lower third of oven and preheat oven to 375\u00b0F. Roll out disk of dough into a 14- by 13-inch rectangle on a lightly floured surface with a lightly floured rolling pin. Fit into tart pan and trim excess dough, leaving a 1/2-inch overhang, then fold overhang under pastry and press against rim of pan to reinforce edge. Fill shell with berries and sprinkle evenly with topping. Bake tart in pan on baking sheet until topping and crust are golden and filling is bubbling, about 55 to 60 minutes (loosely cover with a sheet of foil after 30 minutes to prevent overbrowning). Cool in pan on a rack 20 minutes, then remove side of pan and cool tart completely, about 45 minutes.",
