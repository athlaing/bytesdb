        "instructions": [
            "Cook grits as directed on package, using about 6 cups stock instead of water. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper; coat paper with cooking spray. Stir Parmesan and butter into grits; season with salt and black pepper. Pour grits onto sheet; smooth into an even layer. Cover and refrigerate until very firm, at least 2 1/2 hours or overnight. Use a 2-inch biscuit or round cookie cutter to cut out 16 cakes; cover cakes and refrigerate. A half hour before serving, heat oven to 300\u00b0. In a bowl, toss shrimp with juice and a few shakes of hot pepper sauce. In a large skillet, saut\u00e9 bacon and bell pepper over medium heat until bacon is light brown but not crisp, about 5 minutes. Remove all but 2 teaspoons bacon fat from pan. Reduce heat to medium-low; add scallions and toss to coat. Sprinkle in flour; saut\u00e9, stirring frequently with a wooden spatula, until light brown, 2 to 5 minutes. Add remaining 2/3 cup stock and wine; cook, stirring, until sauce thickens. Season with salt, black pepper and more hot pepper sauce. Add shrimp and any liquid; saut\u00e9 until just opaque, 2 to 5 minutes, being careful not to overcook. Just prior to serving, transfer grits cakes to a baking sheet; bake until warm through, about 6 minutes. Spoon a bit of sauce and 1 shrimp over each cake; garnish with parsley. Do AHEAD: The grits-cake base of these nibbles needs to firm up in the fridge for at least 2 1/2 hours\u2014and more time is fine. Prep it the night before your party.",
