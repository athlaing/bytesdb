            "Preheat oven to 400\u00b0F. Cut white onions, larger cipolline onions, and shallots almost in half, leaving root ends intact. Pry each open slightly to expose cut sides. Place white onions root side down in a foil-lined roasting pan and roast until just beginning to soften and brown, 75-90 minutes.",
            "Add cipolline onions and shallots to roasting pan root end down and roast until all onions and shallots are soft and deeply colored, about 1 hour longer.",
            "Just before onions finish cooking, melt butter in a small saucepan and cook, swirling occasionally, until butter is brown and smells nutty, 5-8 minutes. Let cool slightly; whisk in vinegar and season brown butter with salt.",
            "Divide onions and shallots among plates, leaving skins on; spoon brown butter over."
