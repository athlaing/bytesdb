            "Cook onions in a pot of boiling salted water until slightly softened, about 10 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer to a large bowl; let cool slightly.",
            "Working with 1 onion at a time, make a lengthwise slit from top to bottom with a paring knife, cutting through 2-3 layers of onion, depending on thickness of layers. Gently remove inside layers, allowing outer 2-3 layers to hold their shape. Finely chop enough of the inside layers to measure 1 cup.",

Add 1 tablespoon salt, beef, bay leaves, oregano, and mint; cook, breaking up meat with the back of a spoon, until meat is cooked through, 2-3 minutes. Stir in rice, 1/2 cup wine, and 2 tablespoons lemon juice; cook, stirring often, until liquid is absorbed, about 3 minutes. Add dill and zest; mix well. Season filling with salt and pepper.",

            "Roast onions until crispy on top and slightly browned, about 30 minutes. Serve hot or at room temperature."
