            "Put bread in a 3-quart flameproof shallow baking dish (not glass). Whisk in zest, lemon juice, and 4 cups cream (chill remaining cup cream) and pour over bread. Press down with a spatula to help bread soak up some of custard.",

            "Turn on broiler and broil bread pudding 4 to 5 inches from heat until golden-brown in spots, 2 to 3 minutes. Cool to warm, about 30 minutes (pudding will continue to set).",
            "Just before serving, beat remaining cup cream with syrup using an electric mixer or a whisk until it just holds soft peaks. Serve pudding, warm or chilled, with cream."
