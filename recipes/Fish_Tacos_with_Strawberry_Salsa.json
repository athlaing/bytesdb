            "Olive oil cooking spray",
            "1 pound halibut fillets or steaks (or other firm white fish such as cod or catfish)",
            "1/2 teaspoon ground cumin",
            "1/2 teaspoon salt (preferably kosher), divided",
            "1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, divided",
            "8 small (6-inch) corn tortillas",
            "2 pints strawberries, hulled and chopped",
            "1 small green jalape\u00f1o chile, seeded and chopped",
            "3 tablespoon chopped fresh chives",
            "1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice",

        "instructions": [
            "Heat oven to 450\u00b0F. Coat a rimmed baking sheet with cooking spray. Place fish on baking sheet, smooth side down (if fillets); coat with cooking spray; season with cumin, 1/4 teaspoon salt and 1/8 teaspoon pepper. Stack tortillas, sprinkle with a few drops of water, and wrap tightly in foil. Cook fish and tortillas until fish is opaque and flakes easily with a fork but is still moist, and tortillas are hot, 10 to 15 minutes. In a bowl, combine strawberries, jalape\u00f1o, chives, lemon juice, remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt and remaining 1/8 teaspoon pepper; stir. Flake fish into big pieces; unwrap tortillas. Divide fish, strawberry salsa and cabbage evenly among tortillas. Fold and serve."
