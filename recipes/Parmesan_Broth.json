            "1 halved head of garlic",

            "olive oil, enough to saut\u00e9 garlic and onion",
            "1 handful of thyme",
            "Sprigs of parsley",
            "1 bay leaf",
            "1 shake of black peppercorns",

        "instructions": [
            "I start by saut\u00e9ing a halved head of garlic and a quartered onion in some olive oil, along with a handful of thyme, a few sprigs of parsley, a bay leaf, and a shake of black peppercorns. Once the garlic is browned, I add a cup of dry white wine and simmer, scraping the pot to get the brown bits loosened up, until reduced by half. In goes 1 pound Parmesan rinds and 8 cups of water. The whole thing simmers until it tastes robust and has reduced by half, about 2 hours. (I stir every now and then\u2014the rinds will stick to the bottom of the pot if you let them.) I strain, and then use the broth in vegetable soups, instant-supper pastas, and beans in need of a boost. Then I start hoarding all over again.",
