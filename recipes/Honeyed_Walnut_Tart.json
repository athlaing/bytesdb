            "Position rack in center of oven and preheat to 400\u00b0F. Roll crust out on lightly floured surface to 14-inch round. Transfer to 11-inch-diameter tart pan with removable bottom, allowing crust to drape over pan. Pour filling into crust, spreading evenly. Fold edges over filling, pleating as needed. Brush with egg glaze. Bake tart until filling is deep golden and almost set, about 40 minutes. Transfer to rack; cool 15 minutes. Carefully insert small knife between top edge of crust and pan sides in several places to loosen tart. Gently push up on tart bottom to release tart from sides of pan. Cool completely. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Cover with foil and store at room temperature.) Cut tart into wedges.",
