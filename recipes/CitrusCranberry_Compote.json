            "Finely grate zest from orange and set aside. Using a sharp paring knife, cut off peel and white pith from orange. Working over a small bowl, cut between membranes to release segments into bowl. Combine zest, cranberries, syrup, juice, and vanilla in a medium saucepan. Cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until cranberries have burst and sauce has thickened, 5-10 minutes. Chill until cold. Gently stir orange segments into compote. DO AHEAD: Can be made 3 days ahead. Cover and chill. Return to room temperature before serving.",
