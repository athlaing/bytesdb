        "title": "Pot-Roasted Celery Root with Olives and Buttermilk ",
        "ingredients": [
            "3 tablespoons plus 2 teaspoons extra-virgin olive oil plus more for drizzling",
            "6 small celery roots (celeriac; each about 4 ounces), unpeeled, trimmed with some stem still attached",
            "1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, cut into 1\" cubes",
            "Kosher salt",
            "12 sprigs thyme",
            "6 sprigs rosemary",
            "6 sprigs sage",
            "1 tablespoon coffee beans (optional)",
            "1 cup buttermilk",
            "1/2 lemon",
            "1/4 cup oil-cured black olives, pitted, quartered lengthwise"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Heat 3 tablespoons oil in a large heavy pot over medium heat. Add celery roots and cook, turning frequently, until golden, 8-10 minutes. Add butter and a large pinch of salt. When butter begins to foam, reduce heat to medium-low. Add herb sprigs, coffee beans, if using, and 1 1/2 cups water. Cover and gently cook, adding more water by tablespoonfuls if pan is dry, until celery roots are very tender, about 1 hour.",
            "Remove herbs and coffee beans (if using) from pot and discard. Baste celery roots with buttery juices in pot. Remove from heat. Transfer celery roots to a cutting board, slice in half through stems, and place 2 halves on each plate.",
            "Meanwhile, very gently warm buttermilk in a small saucepan over low heat (it will break if warmed too much). Squeeze in a few drops of lemon juice and add remaining 2 teaspoons oil and a pinch of salt to make a loose sauce. Spoon sauce around celery roots on plates. Garnish with olives, drizzle with oil, and squeeze a few more drops of lemon juice over each."
