        "title": "Parsley Cumin Parathas ",
        "ingredients": [
            "1 1/2 teaspoons cumin seeds, toasted and cooled",
            "1 teaspoon salt",
            "1 cup all-purpose flour plus additional for dusting",
            "3/4 cup whole-wheat flour",
            "1/3 cup coarsely chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley",
            "1/2 cup water",
            "1/4 cup vegetable oil plus additional for griddle",
            "1/3 cup ghee (Indian clarified butter)",
            "Accompaniment: sweet tamarind chutney",
            "an electric coffee/spice grinder; a well-seasoned cast-iron griddle or large skillet"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Grind cumin seeds with salt to a powder in grinder. Transfer to a large bowl and stir in flours, parsley, water, and oil and continue to stir until a dough forms.",
            "Turn out dough onto a work surface and knead until smooth and elastic, about 5 minutes. Several times during kneading, pick up dough and slap it against the work surface 8 to 10 times to relax dough. Cover dough with plastic wrap and let stand at room temperature 1 hour.",
            "Lightly oil griddle, then heat over moderately low heat until hot, 10 to 15 minutes.",
            "While griddle is heating, divide dough into 4 portions, then roll out 1 portion on a lightly floured surface into an 11-inch round. Lightly brush round with some ghee and cut into quarters, then, starting with rounded edge nearest you, fold each quarter in thirds to form a slimmer triangle (bottom edge will still be rounded). Repeat with remaining dough to form a total of 16 slim triangles.",
            "Roll out 1 triangle on a lightly floured surface first to widen it, then to lengthen it into a 9- by- 4-inch triangle, sprinkling with flour as necessary to prevent sticking. Transfer to a baking sheet and cover with a sheet of wax paper, then roll out and cover remaining triangles in same manner, layering them between sheets of wax paper.",
            "Cook parathas , 3 or 4 at a time, on griddle until undersides are browned in spots, 2 to 3 minutes (parathas will puff, then deflate). Turn parathas over and lightly brush with ghee, then cook until other side of each is golden brown in spots, 1 to 2 minutes. Turn over and brush once more, then cook until parathas are cooked through, 1 to 2 minutes.",
            "Transfer each batch of parathas to a sheet of foil as browned and wrap loosely to keep warm while cooking remaining parathas."
