            "Whisk together all cr\u00eape ingredients until smooth, then chill, covered, 30 minutes.",
            "Poach quince: Combine water, sugar, zest, and a pinch of salt in a 3-quart heavy saucepan and cook over moderate heat, stirring, until sugar is dissolved. Add quince and simmer, covered, until fruit is very tender but not falling apart, 1 to 1 1/4 hours. Discard zest.",

            "Cook cr\u00eapes while fruit poaches: Lightly brush an 8- to 9-inch nonstick skillet with butter, then heat over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking. Holding skillet off heat, pour in a scant 1/4 cup batter, immediately tilting and rotating skillet to coat bottom. (If batter sets before skillet is coated, reduce heat slightly.) Return skillet to heat and cook cr\u00eape until just set and golden around edges, 10 to 15 seconds. Loosen edge of cr\u00eape with a heatproof rubber spatula, then transfer cr\u00eape to a plate. Brush skillet with more butter and make 3 more cr\u00eapes in same manner, stacking cr\u00eapes on plate.",

            "Finish preparing quince: Measure out 3/4 cup poached fruit with a slotted spoon and 3 tablespoons cooking syrup (reserve remainder in saucepan), then pur\u00e9e in a food processor with vanilla and 1 tablespoon Calvados until smooth. Transfer remaining fruit from reserved syrup with a slotted spoon to a bowl. Pour syrup through a fine-mesh sieve into another bowl, then return to saucepan and boil until reduced to about 1/2 cup, 8 to 12 minutes. Stir in lemon juice and remaining tablespoon Calvados and cool. Measure out 3/4 cup reserved fruit, then chop and set aside. Stir remaining fruit into reduced syrup and set aside separately.",

            "Make souffl\u00e9s: Put oven rack in middle position and preheat oven to 400\u00b0F. Beat whites with a pinch of salt using an electric mixer at medium-high speed until they just hold soft peaks. Add granulated sugar in a slow stream, beating, and beat at medium-high speed until whites just hold stiff peaks. Fold one third of whites into quince pur\u00e9e, then fold in remaining whites gently but thoroughly. Gently fold in chopped fruit. Brush bottom sides of cr\u00eapes with some melted butter and put in a 15- by 10-inch shallow baking pan (about half of each cr\u00eape will hang over). Divide souffl\u00e9 mixture among cr\u00eapes, spooning it in center and spreading it over half of each cr\u00eape. Gently fold other half of each cr\u00eape over filling to rest on top. Bake until filling is puffed, set, and pale golden in spots, 10 to 12 minutes. Dust cr\u00eapes with confectioners sugar and serve immediately with reserved quince and syrup.",
