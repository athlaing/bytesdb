            "6 tablespoons Oriental sesame oil",
            "1 1/2 teaspoons ground cumin plus additional to taste",

            "In a small bowl stir together the oil, 1 1/2 teaspoons of the cumin, and salt to taste. Halve the pita loaves horizontally to form 6 rounds and brush the rough sides of the rounds with the oil mixture. Cut each round into 3/4-inch triangles or squares, spread the triangles in a jelly-roll pan, and bake them in the middle of a preheated 350\u00b0F. oven shaking the pan every 3 to 4 minutes, for 10 to 12 minutes, or until they are golden. Toss the crisps with the additional cumin and salt to taste and let them cool. The crisps keep in an airtight container for 1 week. Serve the crisps as a topping for vegetable or tossed green salad."
