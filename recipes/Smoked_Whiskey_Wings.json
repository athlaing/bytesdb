        "ingredients": [
            "2 dozen whole chicken wings",
            "Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper",
            "3/4 cup Only Sauce , plus more for serving, optional",
            "1/4 cup whiskey",
            "1 tablespoon sugar",
            "1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons Dijon mustard"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Using kitchen shears or a very sharp knife, cut each wing in half to separate the flat from the drumette; cut off and discard the tip or save it for stock. Wash the pieces well, pat them dry, season liberally with salt and pepper, and set them aside in a large zip-top freezer bag. In a small saucepan, whisk the sauce with the whiskey and sugar and bring just to a simmer over medium-high heat. Remove the sauce from the heat and whisk in the mustard. Cool completely. Pour the mixture in the bag with the chicken wings, seal the bag, and marinate in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes or up to overnight. Prepare a smoker with soaked wood chips and heat it to 250\u00b0F (see Cook's Notes). Alternatively, prepare a charcoal grill (see Cook's Notes) or gas grill (see Cook's Notes) for smoking and heat it to medium-low heat. Remove the wings from the marinade and discard the marinade. Place the wings in a large, shallow aluminum pan in a single layer. Place the uncovered pan in the smoker and cook, for 2 hours. Remove the wings from the smoker and serve with more sauce on the side if you like.",
