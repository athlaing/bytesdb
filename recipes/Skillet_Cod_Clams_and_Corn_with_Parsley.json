        "title": "Skillet Cod, Clams, and Corn with Parsley ",
        "ingredients": [
            "1 1/4 lb. skinless cod fillet, cut into 4 pieces, patted dry",
            "Kosher salt, freshly ground pepper",
            "1/3 cup all-purpose flour",
            "4 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil, divided",
            "1 large shallot, finely chopped",
            "1/3 cup dry white wine",
            "12 littleneck clams, scrubbed",
            "2 medium ears of corn, kernels cut from cobs (1\u20131\u00bc cups)",
            "3 Tbsp. unsalted butter, cut into pieces",
            "1/4 cup chopped parsley",
            "Lemon wedges (for serving)"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Season cod all over with salt and pepper. Sprinkle flour over a large plate and, working one at a time, press side of fillet where skin used to be into flour to thoroughly coat. Tap off excess and set on a platter, flour side up.",
            "Heat 2 Tbsp. oil in a large nonstick skillet with a tight-fitting lid over medium. Cook cod, floured side down, shaking skillet occasionally to prevent sticking, until flesh is opaque and starting to flake around the sides and underside is golden brown, 5\u20137 minutes. Carefully turn cod over and reduce heat to low. Cook until cooked all the way through (flesh should be completely opaque), about 2 minutes (thinner pieces may go more quickly). Place on platter, golden side up; take care not to break up the delicate fillets.",
            "Turn heat back up to medium, pour remaining 2 Tbsp. oil into skillet, and cook shallot, stirring often, until tender and golden, about 2 minutes. Add wine; cook until almost completely evaporated, about 1 minute. Add clams and cover skillet. Cook until clams open, about 5 minutes (some clams might take a few minutes longer). Uncover skillet and transfer clams, discarding any that didn\u2019t open, to platter with cod.",
            "Reduce heat to low and add corn and butter to skillet. Cook, stirring, until butter is melted, sauce is thick and glossy, and corn is tender, about 3 minutes. Spoon corn mixture over fish and clams. Top with parsley; squeeze lemon wedges over."
