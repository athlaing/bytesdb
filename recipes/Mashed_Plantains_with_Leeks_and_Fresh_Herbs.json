            "Bring 7 cups water and broth to boil in heavy large pot. Add plantains. Reduce heat to medium; cover and simmer until plantains are very tender and yellow-orange (some may begin to come out of peel), about 20 minutes. Drain, reserving 1 cup cooking liquid. Cool plantains 10 minutes. Remove peel using hands or small paring knife. Transfer plantains to large glass bowl. Add 1/2 cup of reserved cooking liquid and mash plantains until smooth, adding more liquid by tablespoonfuls to thin mixture, if desired. Set aside. Melt 2 tablespoons butter with olive oil in medium nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add leek and saut\u00e9 until tender but not browned, about 6 minutes. Stir in thyme and parsley. Add leek mixture to mashed plantains; stir to blend. (Can be made 1 hour ahead. Let stand at room temperature. Microwave on high until heated through before continuing.) Mix sour cream and cumin into hot plantains. Season with salt and pepper. Cut 2 tablespoons butter into small cubes. Scatter butter and pecans over; serve.",
