            "Cloves from 1 head of garlic, separated and peeled",
            "1 teaspoon cumin seeds",
            "1 teaspoon mustard seeds",
            "2 1/2 cups cooked chickpeas or 28-ounce can best-quality chickpeas (such as Goya), well rinsed and well drained",
            "Kosher salt and whole black peppercorns",
            "Blended oil (50 percent canola, 50 percent extra-virgin olive), as needed"

        "instructions": [
            "In a Dutch oven or a heavy pot, combine the garlic, cumin, mustard seeds, and chickpeas. Seasons liberally with kosher salt and pepper, and barley cover with blended oil. Cover the pot and cook at 325\u00b0F until aromatic but not browned, about 45 minutes. When the mixture is cool, transfer it, with all the oil, to a sterilized glass container and use as you like. If the chickpeas are covered with oil, the confit will last for at least 3 weeks in the refrigerator. Always save the oil for another use, for example, in a cumin vinaigrette or for saut\u00e9ing.",
