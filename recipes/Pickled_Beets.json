            "1 cup white wine (or any leftover variety of whatevs, boo)",
            "1 cup apple cider vinegar",
            "6 tablespoons pure cane sugar",

            "Preheat the oven to 400\u00b0F.",
            "Wrap the beets in foil, set them on a baking sheet, and roast for 40 minutes. Poke a few holes in the foil, reduce the oven temperature to 350\u00b0F and bake 15 minutes more. Let the beets cool enough to handle comfortably, then remove them from the foil. Peel them while still warm, then cool and cut into 1-inch cubes. Place the beets in a large heatproof bowl or storage container.",
            "In a small saucepan, combine the wine, vinegar, sugar, peppercorns, star anise, thyme, and salt. Pour the mixture over the beets and let cool to room temperature, then store in an airtight container. The beets will keep for up to 10 days in the fridge."
