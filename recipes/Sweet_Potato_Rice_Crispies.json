        "ingredients": [
            "3 Tbsp (42 g) butter",
            "1/4 cup (60 g) pureed sweet potato (about 1 small sweet potato)",
            "1 tbsp (15 ml) vanilla extract",
            "1 tsp salt",
            "11/2 tsp (4 g) ground cinnamon",
            "1/4 tsp ground nutmeg",
            "1/3 cup (50 g) toasted pecans, chopped",
            "1 (10-oz) bag marshmallows",
            "6 cups (210 g) brown rice cereal"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Have an 8 x 8-inch or a 9 x 9-inch baking dish lined with parchment and sprayed with cooking spray nearby.",
            "In a large pot, melt the butter over medium heat, then add the pureed sweet potato, vanilla, salt, cinnamon, nutmeg and toasted pecans. Add the marshmallows and continue to cook, stirring with a wooden spoon, until the marshmallows are melted. Add the cereal, folding gently to combine, and then, working quickly before the mixture stiffens, transfer it to the prepared baking dish, packing the mixture into the pan with a sheet of parchment or wax paper to make an even and dense layer. Allow to cool completely to harden, about 30 minutes, then slice into nine 3-inch squares and serve."
