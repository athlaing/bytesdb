            "Latkes: Set a large strainer over a bowl. In a food processor fitted with the shredding disk, shred the potatoes and onion in batches. Add each batch to the strainer and let stand for 5 minutes, then squeeze dry. Pour off the liquid and rinse the bowl, then add the shredded potato mixture. Stir in the flour, eggs, dill, baking powder, and 1 1/2 teaspoons salt. Scrape the mixture back into the strainer and set it over the bowl again; let stand for another 5 minutes. In a large skillet, heat 1/4 inch of canola oil over medium-high heat until shimmering. Working in batches, spoon a scant 1/4 cup of the potato mixture into the hot oil for each latke, pressing slightly to flatten. Fry over moderate heat, turning once, until the latkes are golden and crisp on both sides, about 7 minutes. Drain the latkes on a paper towel\u2013lined baking sheet. Season well with salt.",
