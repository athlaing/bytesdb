            "2 quarts whole milk",
            "1 cup heavy cream",
            "1/2 teaspoon salt",

        "instructions": [
            "Line a large sieve with a layer of heavy-duty (fine-mesh) cheesecloth and place it over a large bowl.",
            "Slowly bring milk, cream, and salt to a rolling boil in a 6-quart heavy pot over moderate heat, stirring occasionally to prevent scorching. Add lemon juice, then reduce heat to low and simmer, stirring constantly, until the mixture curdles, about 2 minutes.",
