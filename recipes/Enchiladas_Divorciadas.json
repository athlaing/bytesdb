        "instructions": [
            "Heat oil in a large saucepan over medium. Cook onion and garlic, stirring occasionally, until starting to soften, about 5 minutes. Add chiles and cook, stirring occasionally, until onion is lightly browned and vegetables are soft, about 5 minutes. Add tomatillos and cook, stirring occasionally, just until starting to soften, about 3 minutes. Add cilantro and 1 1/2 cups water. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer until tomatillos soften, 20\u201325 minutes. Let cool slightly; transfer to a blender. Pur\u00e9e until smooth; season with salt. Return salsa verde to saucepan and keep warm until ready to use.",
            "Salsa Roja: Heat oil in a large saucepan over medium. Cook onion and garlic, stirring occasionally, until starting to soften, about 5 minutes. Add both chiles, tomatoes, and 1 1/2 cups water. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer until tomatoes and chiles soften, 20\u201325 minutes. Let cool slightly; transfer to a blender. Pur\u00e9e until smooth; season with salt. Return salsa roja to saucepan and keep warm until ready to use.",

            "Enchilada assembly: Place chicken, bay leaves, and allspice in a small pot and pour in water to cover by 1\"; season lightly with salt. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer gently until chicken is nearly cooked through (an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of chicken should register 145\u00b0F\u2013150\u00b0F), 20\u201325 minutes from the time water starts simmering. Let chicken cool at least 1 hour (it should be just warm). If you have the time, cover and chill up to 12 hours. Remove chicken from broth. Pull meat from bones and shred; discard skin and bones. Place meat in a large saucepan and pour in just enough broth to cover. Set aside any remaining broth for another use. Gently reheat chicken over medium-low; season with salt. Meanwhile, mix cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche and queso fresco in a small bowl to combine. Heat oil in a small skillet over medium-high until hot but not smoking. Submerge each tortilla in oil long enough to soften but not so long that they fall apart, 5\u201310 seconds each. Transfer to a rimmed baking sheet lined with paper towels to drain. Working one at a time, fill each tortilla with about 1/3 cup shredded chicken and roll up tightly. Place 3 tortillas each, seam side down, into bowls. Ladle 1/2 cup of each sauce on opposite ends of enchiladas. Top with a big spoonful of cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche mixture and scatter onion over.",
