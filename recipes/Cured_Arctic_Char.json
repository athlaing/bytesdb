            "Cured char: Rinse char under cold running water; pat dry with paper towels. Mix salt, sugar, mustard seeds, orange zest, and lemon zest in a small bowl, then massage into char. Place skin side down in a baking dish; top with dill and drizzle with aquavit. Cover tightly with plastic wrap, pressing directly onto fish. Chill, turning 2\u20133 times and pouring off any accumulated liquid each time, until flesh is very firm and almost translucent, 2\u20134 days (it will get saltier and firmer the longer it sits). Thoroughly rinse char and pat dry with paper towels. DO AHEAD: Char can be cured (and rinsed) 1 week ahead. Cover and chill.",
