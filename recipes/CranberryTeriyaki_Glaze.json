            "1/2 large red onion, sliced",
            "1 1/2 teaspoons minced ginger",
            "1/2 cup dried cranberries, such as Craisins",
            "Zest and juice of 1/2 orange",
            "1/2 cup naturally brewed soy sauce",
            "1 cup cranberry juice",
            "1/4 cup sugar",
            "3 tablespoons grapeseed or canola oil for cooking",

        "instructions": [
            "In a saucepan coated lightly with oil over high heat, saut\u00e9 the onions, ginger and dried cranberries until soft, about 5 minutes. Add the orange zest and juice, naturally brewed soy sauce, cranberry juice, and sugar and bring to a simmer. Reduce by 50 percent over low heat, about 10 to 15 minutes. Check for flavor. Immediately, transfer to a blender and blend until almost smooth (with small bits is preferable), drizzling in oil. Do not blend until super smooth. Check for flavor and adjust seasonings. Let come to room temperature, then transfer to a glass jar, seal and store in fridge for up to two weeks."
