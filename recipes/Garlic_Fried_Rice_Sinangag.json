        "ingredients": [
            "1 cup (240 ml) vegetable oil",
            "1 cup (135 g) garlic cloves, sliced paper thin",
            "4 cups (800 g) freshly cooked jasmine rice, kept hot",
            "Kosher salt",
            "2 to 4 large eggs, fried or sunny-side up"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "In a medium saucepan, heat the vegetable oil over medium heat until the oil begins to shimmer. Line a plate with paper towels and set it nearby.",
            "Carefully pour the garlic into the hot oil and stir continuously until the garlic is just beginning to lightly brown. Remove the pan from the heat and use a slotted spoon to transfer the fried garlic onto the paper towel\u2013lined plate; reserve the oil. Set both the garlic and the oil aside while you make the rice. (You can store the garlic chips and oil in separate airtight containers in the refrigerator for up to a week.)",
            "Fluff the hot rice with a fork and toss it with 1/4 cup (60 ml) of the garlic oil and 1/2 cup (40 g) of the fried garlic chips. (You will have leftover oil and chips for more rice; or try them on the pansits and soups.)",
            "Season the rice with salt and serve right away or at room temperature, with the eggs, if desired."
