        "title": "Pizza Bianca with Scamorza and Shaved Celery Root ",
        "ingredients": [
            "1/4 bulb celery root (celeriac), peeled, very thinly sliced",
            "2 tablespoons olive oil, divided, plus more for baking sheet",
            "Kosher salt, freshly ground pepper",
            "8 ounces prepared pizza dough, room temperature",
            "6 ounces scamorza cheese or smoked mozzarella, thinly sliced",
            "1/2 small red onion, very thinly sliced",
            "1/2 cup grated Parmesan",
            "1 tablespoon fresh oregano leaves, plus more for serving",
            "1 tablespoon drained capers, chopped",
            "Flaky sea salt (such as Maldon)"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Place a rack in lower third of oven; preheat to 500\u00b0F. Toss celery root and 1 tablespoon oil in a medium bowl; season with kosher salt and pepper. Set aside.",
            "Gently stretch dough into a 16x12\" oval and transfer to a lightly oiled rimmed baking sheet. (If dough springs back, cover and let rest 10 minutes, then stretch again, resting as needed.) Brush with remaining 1 tablespoon oil and bake until dry and golden, about 5 minutes (this prevents dough from getting soggy once the toppings are added). Remove from oven; top with cheese, reserved celery root, onion, Parmesan, and 1 tablespoon oregano.",
            "Bake pizza, rotating baking sheet halfway through, until cheese is melted, celery root is tender, and crust is golden brown, 12\u201315 minutes. Top with capers and more oregano; season with sea salt and pepper."
