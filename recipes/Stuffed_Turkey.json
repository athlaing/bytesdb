        "ingredients": [
            "a 12-pound turkey",
            "8 cups cooked rice (be sure the rice is dry and fluffy)",
            "6 tablespoons butter plus 1/2 cup of melted butter",
            "1 cup green onions, finely chopped",
            "1 cup parsley, finely chopped",
            "1 cup chicken or turkey livers, finely chopped",
            "1 cup ham, finely chopped",
            "1 cup pistachio nuts, finely chopped",
            "1 teaspoon rosemary",
            "salt and pepper to taste",
            "1 cup Madeira or 1/2 cup cognac"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "In 6 tablespoons of butter, saut\u00e9 green onions and parsley. Cook for about 5 minutes. Add this to the rice. Add also chicken or turkey livers, ham, pistachio nuts, rosemary, salt and pepper, melted butter and Madeira or cognac.",
            "Stuff the turkey lightly and sew the vent up or close it with small skewers. Remove the neck and secure the skin at the neck cavity in the same manner. Truss the bird, rub it with seasoned butter, spit it and roast it as for chicken. Baste it during the roasting with melted butter mixed with white wine, dry vermouth, Madeira or cognac.",
            "Serve this turkey with a giblet sauce and a large bowl of ice on which you have arranged an assortment of raw vegetables. Pass olive oil flavored with anchovies and anise seeds as an accompaniment. A happy wine choice for this dinner would be a really good ros\u00e9, nicely chilled, of course. For dessert a fine big sponge cake over which you have poured crushed strawberries with Grand Marnier."
