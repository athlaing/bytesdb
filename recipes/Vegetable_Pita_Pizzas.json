            "1 small red bell pepper, sliced thin",
            "1 small green bell pepper, sliced thin",
            "3/4 cup thinly sliced zucchini",
            "4 mushrooms, sliced",
            "1 teaspoon crumbled dried oregano",

        "instructions": [
            "Halve the pita loaves horizontally to form 4 rounds, arrange the rounds, rough sides up, on a baking sheet, and brush the tops lightly with the additional oil. Sprinkle the rounds with salt to taste and toast them in the middle of a preheated 350\u00b0F. oven for 5 minutes, or until they are pale golden and crisp. Sprinkle half the mozzarella onto the rounds and bake the rounds for 1 minute, or until the mozzarella is melted. While the rounds are toasting, in a large skillet cook the onion and the garlic in the remaining 3 tablespoons oil over moderately low heat, stirring, until the onion is softened, add the bell peppers, and cook the mixture, stirring, for 4 minutes, or until the peppers are softened. Add the zucchini, the mushrooms, the oregano, and salt and pepper to taste and cook the mixture, stirring, for 2 minutes, or until the zucchini is softened. Stir in half the remaining mozzarella and divide the mixture among the rounds, mounding it slightly. Top the rounds with the remaining mozzarella, the tomato, the basil, and the Parmesan and broil the rounds under a preheated broiler about 4 inches from the heat for 3 minutes, or until the cheeses are melted and bubbly."
