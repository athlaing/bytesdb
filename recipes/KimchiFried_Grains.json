            "1/2 cup kimchi, plus 3 Tbsp. juice from jar",
            "4 scallions",
            "2 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil",
            "2 large eggs",
            "Kosher salt",
            "1 medium carrot, peeled, cut into matchsticks",
            "2 cups cooked grains (such as farro, spelt, quinoa, or barley)",
            "2 tsp. soy sauce",
            "1 tsp. toasted sesame oil"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Squeeze kimchi over a small bowl to catch juices. Add juice from jar and set aside. Chop kimchi; set aside. Cut dark green tops from scallions and thinly slice; set aside. Thinly slice white and pale green parts and set those aside too. (Whenever you make a stir-fry, you should prep your ingredients in advance, but it doesn\u2019t have to be a whole thing; just scoot these things into their own piles on your cutting board.)",
            "Heat olive oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high. Crack eggs into pan; season with salt. Cook, shaking occasionally to prevent sticking, until whites are golden and crisp around edges and puffing up and set near yolks, about 4 minutes. Transfer eggs to a plate.",
            "Return skillet with oil to medium-high heat, add carrot, and cook, tossing often, until slightly softened, about 2 minutes. Add reserved white and pale green parts of scallions and kimchi and cook, tossing often, until scallions are just golden, about 3 minutes. Add grains, soy sauce, sesame oil, and reserved kimchi juices; cook, tossing, until grains are slightly softened, about 2 minutes. Season with salt; divide between plates. Top with eggs, then nori, sesame seeds, and reserved scallion tops."
