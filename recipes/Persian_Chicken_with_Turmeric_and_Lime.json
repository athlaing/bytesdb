Let sit, covered, until ready to serve. Meanwhile, heat remaining 1 Tbsp. oil over medium-high in a large skillet until very hot but not smoking. Add chicken mixture and cook, stirring occasionally, until chicken is cooked through, 6\u20138 minutes. Remove from heat. Stir in yogurt, if using, then adjust seasoning to taste. Cover to keep warm. Gently toss cucumber, herbs, and remaining 1/4 tsp. salt in a small bowl. Fluff rice with a fork and divide among bowls. Spoon chicken over. Top with cucumber salad, pistachios, and sumac, if using.
