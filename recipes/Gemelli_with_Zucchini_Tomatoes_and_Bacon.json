Pour off all but 3 tablespoons drippings from skillet. Add onion and saut\u00e9 until soft, about 3 minutes. Add wine; boil until reduced by 1/3, about 3 minutes. Meanwhile, cook pasta in large pot of boiling salted water until slightly underdone. Add zucchini and boil until pasta is tender but still firm to bite and zucchini is crisp-tender, stirring occasionally, about 2 minutes longer. Drain. Add pasta, zucchini, bacon, tomatoes, and oregano to onion in skillet. Toss over medium-high heat until sauce coats pasta, about 3 minutes. Add cheese and toss until beginning to melt, about 2 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper and serve.",
