        "ingredients": [
            "2 tablespoons unsalted butter cut into 6 pieces",
            "2 large eggs, lightly beaten, at room temperature",
            "1 cup whole milk, at room temperature",
            "1 cup all-purpose flour",
            "1/2 teaspoon salt"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Preheat the oven to 400\u00b0 F for 20 minutes. Place 1 piece of butter in the bottom of each cup of a six-cup popover tin (or six 1/2-cup custard cups). Place the popover pan on a baking sheet. In a smaller bowl, lightly whisk the eggs until they change color. Whisk in the milk. In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour and salt until well blended. Gently whisk the egg mixture into the flour mixture until only small lumps are left, and set aside. Place the popover tin and baking sheet in the oven for 4 minutes. At 3 minutes, give the batter a light whisk. Using an oven mitt, remove the hot tin from the oven and immediately divide the batter among the prepared cups. Bake for 25 minutes without opening the oven door. The popovers will be puffy, with crisp brown crusts and hollow, moist interiors. Serve immediately.",
