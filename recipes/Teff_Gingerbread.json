            "Preheat the oven to 425\u00b0F. Grease an 8-inch cake pan. Sift the flours, arrowroot, potato starch, xanthan gum, baking powder, baking soda, spices, and sea salt into a medium bowl. Stir until combined. In a separate large bowl combine the oil, rice milk, molasses, and egg and whisk together by hand or beat on low with a mixer until combined. Add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients in thirds, mixing to incorporate after each addition. Pour the batter into the prepared pan and use a wet flexible rubber spatula to smooth the top. Bake 15 minutes, then reduce the heat to 400\u00b0F and bake another 35 minutes, or until the center bounces back when pressed gently with your fingertip.",
