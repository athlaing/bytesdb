            "Preheat oven to 300\u00b0F. Line rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper. Combine all ingredients in processor. Using on/off turns, blend until coarse crumbs form. Spread crumbs out on prepared baking sheet (if necessary, break up any large pieces with fingertips). Bake until crumbs are crisp, stirring once, about 10 minutes. Cool. DO AHEAD: Can be made 1 day ahead. Store airtight at room temperature.",
            "For puddings: Whisk sugar, cornstarch, cocoa powder, espresso powder, and salt in heavy medium saucepan. Add egg yolks and whisk to blend (mixture will resemble wet sand). Gradually whisk in milk, then cream. Whisk constantly over medium heat until mixture comes to boil, then boil 30 seconds. Remove from heat. Add chocolate, whiskey, butter, and vanilla; whisk until chocolate and butter melt and mixture is smooth. Let pudding cool slightly, whisking occasionally, about 10 minutes. Spoon 1/3 cup pudding into each of six 1-cup glasses; spread evenly. Sprinkle each with graham cracker crumbs, dividing equally. Top each with 1/3 cup pudding, spreading evenly. Cover each with plastic wrap, pressing plastic directly onto pudding. Chill at least 2 hours. DO AHEAD: Can be made 1 day ahead. Keep chilled.",

            "For marshmallow topping: Blend all ingredients in large bowl of stand mixer fitted with whisk attachment. Set mixer bowl with egg white mixture over saucepan of simmering water. Using hand whisk, whisk mixture constantly until instant-read thermometer inserted into mixture registers 160\u00b0F, about 6 minutes. Attach mixer bowl with egg white mixture to stand mixer again and beat on high speed until marshmallow topping forms stiff peaks, 6 to 8 minutes. Top each pudding with 2 large spoonfuls of marshmallow topping, covering top completely and creating peaks, if desired. DO AHEAD: Can be made 2 hours ahead. Chill. Using kitchen butane torch, lightly toast marshmallow topping until golden in spots.",
