Cut squid bodies crosswise into thin slices and halve tentacles crosswise. Scrub mussels and rinse well, then cook in a 5- to 6-quart heavy pot over moderately high heat, covered, until shells are opened, 4 to 6 minutes, checking frequently after 4 minutes and transferring mussels as opened to a bowl. (Discard any unopened mussels after 6 minutes.) Cool mussels, then remove from shells. Whisk together vinegar, citrus juices, oil, garlic, salt, and pepper in a bowl and add squid, mussels, fennel, onion, and parsley, tossing to combine. Serve salad on endive leaves.",
