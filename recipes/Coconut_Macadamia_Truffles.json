Bring cream to a simmer in a medium skillet. Remove from heat and stir in rum. Whisk in white chocolate until melted and ganache is smooth. Stir in nuts. Pour ganache into a plastic-wrap\u2013lined 8-inch square baking pan and chill, uncovered, until firm, about 4 hours. Invert ganache onto a work surface and remove plastic wrap. Cut ganache into 64 squares and roll each piece between your palms to form a ball. When all balls are formed, roll in coconut to cover completely, then chill truffles, covered, until ready to serve.",
