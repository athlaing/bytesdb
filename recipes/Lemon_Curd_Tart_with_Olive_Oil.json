            "Make tart shell: Preheat oven to 425\u00b0F with rack in middle. Pulse almonds with flour, sugar, and sea salt to a fine powder in a food processor. Add butter and pulse until mixture resembles coarse meal with some small (roughly pea-size) butter lumps. Add yolk and oil and pulse until just incorporated and a very soft dough has formed. Spread dough evenly over bottom and up side of pan with offset spatula. Chill until firm, about 30 minutes. Bake shell until golden brown all over, about 13 minutes. Transfer to a rack to cool completely, about 30 minutes.",
