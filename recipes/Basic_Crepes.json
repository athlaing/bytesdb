            "If necessary, add more milk by tablespoonfuls to batter to thin to consistency of heavy whipping cream. Heat 8-inch-diameter nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Brush with melted butter. Pour 3 tablespoons batter into skillet and swirl to coat bottom evenly. Cook until top appears dry, loosening sides of crepe with spatula, about 45 seconds.
