            "3 tablespoons all-purpose flour",
            "1 cup cold whole milk",
            "1 cup grated Gruy\u00e8re, divided",

            "4 large eggs, yolks and whites separated",

        "instructions": [
            "Preheat oven to 400\u00b0F. Brush ramekins with butter and place on a foil-lined baking sheet; sprinkle ramekins with 2 tablespoons Parmesan (total). Chill for 20 minutes or, covered, up to 1 day. Melt 3 tablespoons butter in a small saucepan over medium heat. Add flour; whisk constantly for 30 seconds. Gradually whisk in milk; increase heat and bring to a boil, whisking constantly. Add remaining 2 tablespoons Parmesan and 1/2 cup Gruy\u00e8re; stir until melted. Add nutmeg and season with salt and pepper. Transfer b\u00e9chamel to a medium bowl and cover with plastic wrap; set aside. Place egg whites in a large bowl. Stir in a pinch of salt and xanthan gum, if using. Using an electric mixer, beat egg whites until firm but not stiff, 3-4 minutes. Stir egg yolks into b\u00e9chamel. Gently stir in 1/4 of beaten egg whites to loosen b\u00e9chamel base, then gently fold in remaining egg whites just to combine, taking care not to deflate. Divide mixture among ramekins; sprinkle with 1/2 cup Gruy\u00e8re. Run your finger around inside lip of ramekins, cleaning edges. Bake until souffl\u00e9s rise, centers are set, and cheese is golden brown, 18-22 minutes. Serve immediately.",
