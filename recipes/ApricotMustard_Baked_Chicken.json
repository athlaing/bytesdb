        "ingredients": [
            "6 to 8 skin-on chicken pieces (thighs or drumsticks), rinsed and patted dry",
            "Salt and pepper",
            "3/4 cup apricot jam",
            "1 tablespoon grainy mustard",
            "1/4 cup water",
            "Leaves from 2 sprigs fresh thyme"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Preheat the oven to 400\u00b0F.",
            "Place the chicken on a rimmed cookie sheet or baking dish lined with foil or parchment paper, sprinkle with salt and pepper, and bake for 10 minutes.",
            "While the chicken is baking, whisk together the jam, mustard, water, thyme, and a little salt and pepper in a small saucepan over low heat for about 3 minutes. It should be slightly syrupy.",
            "Pull the chicken out of the oven and pour the sauce on top. Continue baking for another 15 minutes. For the last 3 minutes, place the chicken under the broiler on the top rack so it gets golden and crispy looking."
