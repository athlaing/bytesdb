            "Preheat oven to 400\u00b0F. Place butter and shortening in freezer for 10 minutes.",
            "Blend 4 cups flour and next 5 ingredients in a food processor. Add butter and shortening. Pulse mixture until it resembles coarse meal, 20-25 pulses. Transfer mixture to a large bowl. Gradually add buttermilk while tossing mixture with a fork (mixture will not be completely incorporated). Knead in bowl with lightly floured hands just until dough forms, about 3 turns.",
            "Transfer dough to a lightly floured surface. Pat out dough until 1\" thick. Lift 1 side and fold it over. Gently repeat 5 more times. Roll dough to 3/4\"-thick round. Using a 3\" biscuit cutter, cut biscuits from dough. Gather scraps and repeat patting out and cutting biscuits for a total of 10 biscuits.",
            "Place biscuits on a parchment paper- lined baking sheet, spaced 1\"-2\" apart. Bake until golden brown and a tester inserted horizontally comes out clean, 12-15 minutes. Transfer biscuits to a wire rack; let cool slightly. Serve warm or at room temperature. DO AHEAD: Can be made 8 hours ahead. Let cool completely. Store airtight at room temperature. Rewarm before serving.",
            "For fried chicken: Whisk buttermilk, dill, 1 1/2 teaspoons salt, 1 teaspoon pepper, and cayenne in a large bowl. Add chicken; turn to coat. Cover; chill at least 3 hours or overnight. Pour vegetable oil in a large pot to a depth of 2\". Attach a deep-fry thermometer to side of pot. Heat oil over medium heat to 350\u00b0F. Whisk 1 1/4 cups water with remaining 2 teaspoons salt, remaining 3/4 teaspoon pepper, flour, and next 6 ingredients in a large bowl. Drain chicken well; pat dry with paper towels. Working in batches, dip chicken into batter. Fry chicken, turning occasionally, until skin is crispy and golden brown and chicken is just cooked through, 9-12 minutes per batch. Drain chicken on paper towels. Split biscuits in half; place 1 bottom half on each plate. Top each with a cheese slice, if desired, then a chicken thigh. Spoon Sausage Gravy over chicken, if desired. Place biscuit top over.",
