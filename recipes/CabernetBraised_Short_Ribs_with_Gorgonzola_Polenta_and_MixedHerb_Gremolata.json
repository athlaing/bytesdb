        "title": "Cabernet-Braised Short Ribs with Gorgonzola Polenta and Mixed-Herb Gremolata ",
        "ingredients": [
            "8 to 9 pounds meaty beef short ribs",
            "2 tablespoons chopped fresh rosemary",
            "2 tablespoons chopped fresh thyme",
            "1 tablespoon coarse kosher salt",
            "1 tablespoon freshly ground black pepper",
            "1/4 cup (about) vegetable oil",
            "2 750-ml bottles Cabernet Sauvignon",
            "2 tablespoons (1/4 stick) butter, room temperature",
            "2 teaspoons all purpose flour",
            "Gorgonzola Polenta",
            "Mixed-Herb Gremolata"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "With its various elements, this dish lends itself well to team cooking. Seasoning the meat ahead, making the gremolata, browning the ribs, and deglazing the pan are separate steps that allow everyone to take turns. But if you'd prefer to work ahead, the short ribs will taste just as good a day later. Either way, you're golden.",
            "Arrange ribs in single layer in 15x10x2-inch glass baking dish. Mix rosemary, thyme, salt, and pepper in small bowl; sprinkle all over ribs. Cover and refrigerate overnight. Let stand at room temperature 1 hour before continuing.",
            "Preheat oven to 375\u00b0F. Heat 2 tablespoons oil in heavy wide ovenproof pot over medium-high heat. Working in batches, add ribs to pot and cook until browned on all sides, about 8 minutes per batch, adding more oil to pot by tablespoonfuls as needed. Transfer ribs to large bowl. Pour off drippings from pot; discard. Add wine to pot and bring to simmer, scraping up any browned bits. Return ribs and any accumulated juices to pot; bring to boil. Cover; transfer to oven and braise until meat is very tender and almost falling off bones, about 2 hours. DO AHEAD: Can be made 1 day ahead. Chill uncovered until cold, then cover and keep chilled.",
            "Bring to simmer before continuing. Using slotted spoon, transfer ribs to large bowl; cover tightly to keep warm. Skim any fat from top of braising liquid. Boil liquid until reduced to 2 generous cups, about 20 minutes. Mix 2 tablespoons butter and 2 tablespoons flour with fork in small bowl until well blended. Whisk butter mixture into reduced braising liquid. Whisk over medium-high heat until sauce thickens very slightly, about 2 minutes.",
            "Divide Gorgonzola Polenta among plates. Top with ribs and sauce. Sprinkle with Mixed-Herb Gremolata and serve."
