        "ingredients": [
            "1 large bunch kale",
            "1 tablespoon olive oil",
            "4 (6\u20138-ounce) salmon fillets",
            "Kosher salt and black pepper",
            "1/2 cup store-bought teriyaki sauce (look for the thick kind)"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Preheat the oven to 425\u00b0F. Strip the stems and center ribs out of the kale leaves and place the leaves on a baking sheet. Discard the ribs and stems. Tear the leaves into smaller chunks.",
            "Drizzle the kale with olive oil and toss, making sure the oil lightly coats all the pieces.",
            "Nestle the salmon among the kale leaves, skin side down (if your fillets have skin) and sprinkle them with salt and pepper. Drizzle a couple of teaspoons of teriyaki sauce over each fillet and brush it to lightly coat the surface.",
            "Bake for about 10 minutes, shaking the pan once to make sure the kale doesn\u2019t burn. (It should brown a little around the edges.)",
            "Warm the remaining teriyaki sauce in the microwave for about 15 seconds and pour it over each piece of salmon, letting it sit for a couple of minutes before serving. (I can\u2019t even wait for a plate!)"
