            "100g (7 tbsp) butter",
            "75g (1/3 cup) superfine sugar, plus extra to dust",
            "100g (3/4 cup) plain all-purpose flour",
            "1/2 tsp baking soda",
            "50g (1/4 cup) plain yogurt",
            "1 egg",
            "1 tsp vanilla extract or vanilla bean paste",
            "1 tbsp raspberry jam",

        "instructions": [
            "Preheat the oven to 400\u00b0F/200\u00b0C/180\u00b0C fan/gas 6. Melt the butter in the microwave or in a pan over a medium heat and use a pastry brush to grease all the holes of the muffin tray with some of the melted butter. Place the sugar, flour and baking soda in a bowl and combine. In a small jug, mix the remaining melted butter with the yogurt, egg and vanilla. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and gently fold them together until just incorporated. Divide the mixture among the 24 holes in the muffin tray using a teaspoon, then bake for 7\u20138 minutes or until golden brown and risen. While the muffins are baking, spoon the jams into the 2 piping bags and snip the end off each with a pair of scissors. Remove the hot doughnuts muffins from the oven and roll them in superfine sugar, then make a small hole with a skewer in the bottom of each and pipe raspberry jam into the centre of half the doughnuts and apricot jam into the rest. These are best enjoyed fresh from the oven.",
