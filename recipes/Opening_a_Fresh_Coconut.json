            "Heat the oven to 375\u00b0. Pierce the two or three \"eyes\" at one end with a clean screwdriver . Drain and refrigerate the liquid; use or freeze within 24 hours.",
            "Bake the drained coconut until the shell starts to crack, 20 to 25 minutes. Remove from the oven and cool. When cool enough to handle, tap it all over with a hammer to release the meat within the shell.",
            "Cover the coconut with a towel and hit the coconut hard with a hammer to break it open. The meat will separate from the hard outer shell.",
            "Remove the skin from the flesh with a vegetable peeler or paring knife. Use immediately or freeze pieces tightly wrapped in plastic film for later use."
