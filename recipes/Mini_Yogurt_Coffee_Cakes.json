            "Preheat oven to 325\u00b0F. Butter all surfaces of a 6-cup mini Bundt pan with 1-cup molds. Combine brown sugar, almonds, and cinnamon; set aside. Beat together butter, granulated sugar, eggs, vanilla, and yogurt in a small bowl. Mix flour, baking powder, and soda in large bowl. Add the yogurt-and-egg mixture, and stir until just blended. Place about 2 tbsp batter in bottom of Bundt molds. Divide brown sugar filling evenly among molds. Fill molds evenly with remaining batter. Bake 25 to 30 minutes until cakes are firm to the touch and edges are brown and pull away from sides of pan. Cool 5 minutes in pan. Turn out on a rack and cool with flat side down. Lightly dust with confectioners' sugar before serving."
