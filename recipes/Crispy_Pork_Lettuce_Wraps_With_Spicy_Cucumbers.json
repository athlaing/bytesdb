            "Diagonally score fat side of pork belly, cutting through fat but stopping at flesh and spacing about 1/4\" apart. Season pork with salt and pepper and sprinkle with 1 tablespoon brown sugar. Wrap tightly in plastic wrap and let sit at least 2 hours, or chill up to 2 days. Preheat oven to 400\u00b0F. Unwrap pork and place in the smallest baking dish you can. Add chiles de \u00e1rbol, star anise, soy sauce, remaining 1 tablespoon brown sugar, and 1 1/4 cups water. Roast until most of fat has rendered, meat is tender, and top is browned and crisp, 2\u20132 1/2 hours. Meanwhile, toss cucumbers, scallions, red chile, and vinegar in a small bowl to combine. Mix gochujang and miso in another small bowl. Transfer pork to a cutting board; let rest 10 minutes. Pour off pan juices into a measuring glass. Skim fat from surface. Slice pork into 1/2\" slices, transfer to a platter, and pour pan juices over. Serve with lettuce for wrapping and cucumber salad, mint, kimchi (if using), and gochugang-miso mixture for topping.",
