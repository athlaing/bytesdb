        "instructions": [
            "Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Fill a bowl halfway with ice and water. Slice carrots with a spiral cutter into long, thin spirals (or julienne them). Then cut each curl crosswise to make 3-inch-long sections. Blanch carrots in hot water for about 10 seconds. Remove and plunge into ice water. Drain and set aside. Whisk oil, orange juice and vinegar in a bowl. Add salt and mix well. Set aside. Toast pistachios in a small pan until fragrant. Chop into pieces. Blend diced beets in a blender until smooth; set aside. Toss carrots with dressing. Divide carrots among 8 small plates. Spoon 1 tablespoon yogurt onto each plate, next to each mound of carrots, then spoon 1 tablespoon beet puree on top of yogurt. Divide raspberries and pistachios among plates. Garnish with mint and cilantro."
