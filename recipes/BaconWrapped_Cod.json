        "ingredients": [
            "1 pound (500g) fresh cod fillet",
            "Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper",
            "3 ounces (90g) thinly sliced slab bacon, rind removed",
            "1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil",
            "1/2 cup fresh flat-leaf parsley leaves",
            "1 shallot",
            "1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil",
            "3 tablespoons capers"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "1. Season the cod all over lightly with salt and pepper. Roll or fold the cod so that it looks like a small roast, and wrap the bacon around it, securing the pieces of bacon with a skewer or toothpick, so the cod is almost completely covered with the bacon (except at the \"corners\").",
            "2. In a heavy-bottomed skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat. When the oil is hot, add the fish and brown it on all sides, which will take about 6 minutes. Cover the skillet and continue cooking the cod until it is cooked through, about 16 minutes, turning it occasionally so it doesn't burn.",
            "3. While the cod is cooking, make the sauce. Mince together the parsley and the shallot and place in a small bowl. Whisk in the oil. Coarsely chop the capers and whisk them into the sauce.",
            "4. When the fish is cooked, transfer it to a warmed serving platter and let it sit for about 4 minutes. Remove the skewers or the toothpicks and drain away any liquid that comes from the fish. Pour the sauce over the fish and serve."
