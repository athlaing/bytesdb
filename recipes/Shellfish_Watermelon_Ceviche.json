Stir together chopped orange, orange juice, lime juice, watermelon, ginger, onion, jalape\u00f1o (to taste), and salt in a large bowl. Bring a 1-quart saucepan three-fourths full of salted water to a boil, then add scallops. Reduce heat to a bare simmer and poach scallops until just cooked through, about 1 minute. Transfer with a slotted spoon to a bowl of ice and cold water to stop cooking. Return water in saucepan to a boil and poach shrimp in same manner. Drain shrimp in a colander and transfer to bowl of ice and cold water to stop cooking. Drain scallops and shrimp well and pat dry.

Serve ceviche with lettuce leaves on the side (use a slotted spoon to transfer ceviche to lettuce).",
