        "ingredients": [
            "1 1/4 cups water",
            "1/2 cup Chinese black rice",
            "1/4 cup finely chopped pitted dates (about 6)",
            "2 dates, pitted and cut into thin strips",
            "3 teaspoons rose water",
            "1 1/4 cups half-and-half",
            "2 tablespoons turbinado sugar",
            "Pinch of fine sea salt",
            "1 teaspoon finely grated lemon zest",
            "1 (1-inch) piece cinnamon stick",
            "1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "1 To prepare the rice, bring the water and rice to a boil in a small heavy-bottomed saucepan. Decrease the temperature to maintain a simmer, cover, and cook until the rice is tender yet still slightly chewy, about 30 minutes. Some water will remain (do not drain).",
            "2 While the rice is cooking, prepare the date topping. Place the chopped dates in a small bowl and drizzle with 2 teaspoons of the rose water. Add the date strips to a different small bowl and drizzle with the remaining 1 teaspoon rose water. Stir the dates in both bowls and set aside, stirring once or twice more.",
            "3 To finish, add the half-and-half, sugar, salt, 1/2 teaspoon of the lemon zest, cinnamon stick, and vanilla to the rice. Return to a boil over medium-high heat, stirring several times. Decrease the heat to maintain a gentle bubble and cook, uncovered, for 15 more minutes, stirring every few minutes or so. The consistency should be creamy yet soupy \u2014 the mixture will thicken as it cools. Remove the saucepan from the heat and remove the cinnamon stick. Stir in the chopped dates and the remaining 1/2 teaspoon lemon zest.",
            "4 Divide the rice pudding among small individual dessert bowls or cups. Garnish with a few of the rose water-infused date strips, and serve warm or at room temperature."
