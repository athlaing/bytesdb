            "Make pasta: Stir together matzo meal and 1/2 teaspoon salt in a bowl. Make a well in center and add eggs and yolk, then lightly beat eggs with a fork. Add water and oil and stir until dough just comes together. Knead dough 5 or 6 times. Form into a 5-inch square and put on a work surface dusted with potato starch, then dust dough with potato starch. Let stand 10 minutes. Meanwhile, dust a large baking pan with some potato starch. Quarter dough. Roll out each piece on a surface dusted with potato starch until as thin as possible (1/16 inch thick) and about 10 by 8 inches, dusting rolling pin and surface of dough as needed. (If dough tears, patch it.) Using a pizza wheel or sharp knife, cut into long 1/2-inch-wide strips and transfer to pan in 1 layer along with any broken pieces of dough. Cook in a pasta pot of boiling salted water (2 tablespoons salt for 6 quarts water) until just tender, 1 to 2 minutes. Reserve 1 cup cooking water, then drain pasta in a colander.",
