            "1 3/4 sticks (14 tablespoons) unsalted butter, room temperature, plus more for the pan",
            "1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour",
            "1 1/2 cups (about 5 ounces) blanched almonds, finely ground",
            "3/4 cups sugar",
            "1/4 teaspoon salt",
            "1 1/2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Butter a 10-inch springform pan; set aside. In a large bowl, whisk together flour, ground almonds, sugar, salt, and vanilla. Cut in the butter with a pastry blender until it is completely incorporated and there are no dry crumbs. Squeeze the mixture to form pea-size to 1-inch clumps.",
            "Gently press three-quarters of the mixture into the prepared pan, and sprinkle evenly with remaining crumbs. Bake until cookie begins to turn golden, about 25 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 300 degrees F, and continue to bake until golden brown and fairly dry, about 10 minutes more. Transfer pan to a wire rack to cool completely. Remove sides of pan to unmold. Cookie can be kept, wrapped well in aluminum foil, at room temperature for up to 3 days."
