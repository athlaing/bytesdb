            "Bring 1 1/2 inches water (do not salt water) to a boil in pot, then add corn. Cook corn (water may not cover it), covered with lid, turning occasionally, until tender, 3 to 5 minutes. Transfer with tongs to a large platter.",
            "While corn cooks, melt butter in a 1-quart heavy saucepan, then remove from heat and stir in lemon juice, salt, black pepper, and cayenne.",
            "When corn is just cool enough to handle, cut kernels off cobs in long, wide strokes with a large heavy knife, leaving kernels in clusters. Transfer to a serving bowl.",
            "Add butter mixture and cilantro to corn, stirring gently to keep kernel clusters intact. Serve warm or at room temperature."
