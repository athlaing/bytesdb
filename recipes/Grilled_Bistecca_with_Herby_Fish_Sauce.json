        "title": "Grilled Bistecca with Herby Fish Sauce ",
        "ingredients": [
            "2 (1 1/2\"\u20132\"-thick) porterhouse steaks (about 6 lb. total)",
            "1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil, divided",
            "Kosher salt",
            "3 Tbsp. freshly ground black pepper",
            "2 garlic cloves, finely grated",
            "1/4 cup fish sauce",
            "2 Tbsp. coarsely chopped marjoram, rosemary, and/or thyme"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Rub steak with 1/4 cup oil; season with salt and sprinkle with pepper (it should nearly cover both sides). Let sit at room temperature 30 minutes.",
            "Mix garlic, fish sauce, herbs, and remaining 1/4 cup oil in a small bowl.",
            "Prepare a grill for medium-high indirect heat (for a gas grill, leave one or two burners off; for a charcoal grill, bank coals on one side of grill). Grill steaks over direct heat until nicely charred, about 2 minutes per side. Move steaks over indirect heat and continue grilling, basting with fish sauce mixture, until browned all over, about 5 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of steaks should register 120\u00b0F for rare; temperature will rise to 125\u00b0F (or medium-rare) as they rest. Transfer to a cutting board and let rest 20 minutes before slicing against the grain."
