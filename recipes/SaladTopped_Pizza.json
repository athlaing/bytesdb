        "instructions": [
            "Heat broiler. In a large roasting pan, combine onion, zucchini, squash, and red pepper with oil, garlic, herbs and salt. Toss well. Place in oven, about 5 inches from heating element, and broil, stirring occasionally, until vegetables are wilted and somewhat reduced in volume, about 8 to 10 minutes. (Or combine ingredients in a large nonstick skillet and cook 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.) Let vegetables cool on a plate while you prepare the pizza crust. Heat oven to 450\u00b0F. Place pizza crust on a cutting board and sprinkle crust with half the shredded mozzarella. Spread tomato sauce over cheese. Layer cooked vegetables evenly over pizza. Top with remaining cheese. Slide pizza directly from cutting board onto oven rack or bake on baking sheet until pizza is heated through and cheese is bubbling and lightly browned, about 15 minutes. Right before serving pizza, toss salad ingredients together in a large bowl. Pile salad in the center of the pizza."
