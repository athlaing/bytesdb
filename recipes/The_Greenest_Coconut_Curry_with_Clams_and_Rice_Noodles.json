            "Pur\u00e9e chopped chile, ginger, lemongrass, garlic, fish sauce, brown sugar, and 3 cups water in a blender until smooth. Transfer curry to a small bowl. Reserve blender (no need to clean). Pur\u00e9e coconut cream, cilantro, 3 cups basil, and 1/4 cup ice water in blender until very smooth; set herb pur\u00e9e aside. Heat oil in a large saucepan or small pot over medium-high. Add clams, cover, and cook until clams open, 5\u20137 minutes. Uncover and transfer opened clams to a medium bowl, reserving cooking liquid in saucepan. If any clams are still closed, cover and cook a few minutes longer, then add to bowl with others; discard any clams that refuse to open. Add curry base to saucepan and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer 10 minutes to let flavors meld. Meanwhile, cook noodles according to package directions. Drain and rinse under cold water. Divide among bowls. Using a slotted spoon, transfer clams to noodle bowls. Pour any accumulated clam-cooking liquid into curry mixture and stir in herb pur\u00e9e; bring to a boil. Immediately remove from heat and squeeze in juice from lime. Taste and season with salt if needed. Ladle curry over clams and noodles. Top with sliced chile and basil leaves.",
