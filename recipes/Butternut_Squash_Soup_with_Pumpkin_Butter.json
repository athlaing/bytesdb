            "Vegetable oil spray",
            "1 2-pound butternut squash, halved lengthwise and seeded",
            "2 cups low-sodium chicken broth",
            "1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon",
            "1/2 teaspoon dried marjoram",
            "1/2 teaspoon dried thyme",
            "Pinch of grated nutmeg",
            "1 cup milk or half-and-half",
            "Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper",

        "instructions": [
            "Preheat the oven to 375 \u00b0F. Spray a 9 x 13-inch baking dish with the vegetable oil spray. Place the squash halves, cut side down, in the prepared dish. Pierce the skin sides several times with a fork. Bake until the squash is tender, about 45 minutes. Set aside until cool enough to handle. Using a large spoon, scrape the flesh from the cooked squash into a food processor. Discard the skins. Add 1 1/2 cups of the chicken broth, the cinnamon, marjoram, thyme, and nutmeg and puree until smooth. Transfer the puree to a large saucepan. Whisk the milk into the soup over medium heat. If you prefer a thinner consistency, add the remaining broth. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Ladle the soup into warmed bowls. Top with a dollop of pumpkin butter and sprinkle with chopped pistachio nuts before serving.",
