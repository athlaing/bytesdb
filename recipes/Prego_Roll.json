        "ingredients": [
            "6 garlic cloves",
            "1 tablespoon packed flat-leaf parsley leaves",
            "Pinch of kosher salt",
            "8 tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temperature",
            "1 pound skirt steak, trimmed of excess fat",
            "5 garlic cloves",
            "8 to 10 parsley sprigs",
            "1/4 cup soy sauce",
            "1/4 cup olive oil",
            "4 Portuguese rolls",
            "1/2 cup garlic butter"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "For the garlic butter: Mince the garlic and finely chop the parsley leaves. Mix the garlic, parsley, and salt into the butter until very well combined. This will keep, refrigerated, for up to 2 weeks.",
            "Mince the garlic and finely chop the parsley leaves. Mix the garlic, parsley, and salt into the butter until very well combined. This will keep, refrigerated, for up to 2 weeks.",
            "For the sandwich: Cut the steak into 4 equal portions. Smash the garlic cloves using the side of your knife. Pick the parsley leaves and coarsely chop them; set aside. In a small bowl, mix the soy sauce, olive oil, and smashed garlic. Pour over the steak, cover, and marinate for 1 hour or up to 12 hours. In a very hot cast-iron skillet, sear each side of the steak, cooking to your preference. (Skirt steak cooks very quickly; for medium, cook for 2 to 3 minutes on each side.) Transfer to a plate when finished. While the meat is resting, wipe out the skillet and set it over low heat. Cut each roll in half and liberally butter each side with garlic butter. Toast the rolls, cut side down, until golden brown in color. On a cutting board slice the steaks across the grain (lengthwise) into 1-inch strips or pieces. Lay the meat on a roll and top with chopped parsley.",
