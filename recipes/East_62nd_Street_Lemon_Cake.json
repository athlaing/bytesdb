            "8 ounces (2 sticks) unsalted butter",
            "2 cups sugar",
            "4 large eggs",
            "1 cup milk",
            "Finely grated zest of 2 large lemons",

        "instructions": [
            "For the cake: Adjust an oven rack one-third up from the bottom of oven. Preheat the oven to 350\u00b0F. Butter a plain or fancy tube pan with an 11- to 12-cup capacity and dust it lightly with fine, dry bread crumbs. Sift together flour, baking powder, and salt and set aside. In large bowl of electric mixer, beat the butter to soften it a bit. Add the sugar and beat for 2 to 3 minutes. Beat in the eggs individually, scraping the bowl as necessary with a rubber spatula to keep mixture smooth. On lowest speed, alternately add the dry ingredients in three additions and the milk in two additions, scraping the bowl with the rubber spatula as necessary and beating only until incorporated after each addition. Remove the bowl from the mixer. Stir in lemon zest. Turn the batter into prepared pan. Level top by rotating pan briskly back and forth. Bake for 1 hour and 5 to 10 minutes, until a cake tester comes out dry. Let cake stand in the pan for about 5 minutes and then cover with a rack and invert. Place over a large piece of aluminum foil or wax paper.",

            "For the glaze: The glaze should be used immediately after it is mixed: Stir the lemon juice and sugar together and brush all over the hot cake until absorbed. Let cake cool completely. Use two wide metal pancake turners or a cookie sheet to transfer it to a cake plate. Do not cut for at least several hours.",

            "Variations: I have made this with 1/2 cup Key lime juice in the glaze in place of the 1/3 cup lemon juice and it is divine. (But you should continue to use the lemon zest in the cake itself.)",
