            "Paprika Vinaigrette: Heat oil and paprika in a small saucepan over medium heat, swirling pan occasionally, until warm, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and let stand until oil is cool and turns dark red, 1\u20131 1/2 hours. Strain paprika oil through a fine-mesh sieve lined with cheesecloth into a small bowl. Mix in shallot, capers, parsley, vinegar, and red pepper flakes; season with salt.",

            "Steak and Assembly: Let steaks stand at room temperature 1 hour before grilling. Prepare grill for 2-zone heat (for a charcoal grill, bank coals on 1 side of grill; for a gas grill, leave 1 or 2 burners off). Rub steaks with oil and season with salt and pepper. Cook steaks over direct heat, moving to a cooler area if flare-up occurs, until charred, about 4 minutes per side. Using tongs, hold steaks vertically to sear edges (bone side and fat-cap side) and render some fat, about 2 minutes per side. Grill steaks over indirect heat, turning occasionally, until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center registers 125\u00b0 for medium-rare. Transfer steaks to a cutting board and let rest 10-15 minutes. (Keep charcoal grill hot.) Mix brown sugar and piment d'Espelette in a small bowl. Sprinkle over steaks and grill over direct heat until sugar is caramelized, about 1 minute per side. Transfer to a cutting board and slice. Serve with vinaigrette.",
