        "ingredients": [
            "1 large head garlic, left unpeeled, plus 4 large cloves, divided",
            "1/4 cup kosher salt",
            "1 tablespoon finely chopped thyme",
            "1 teaspoon Quatre \u00e9pices (French four-spice blend)",
            "2 large shallots, finely chopped (1/4 cup)",
            "2 Turkish bay leaves or 1 California, crumbled",
            "6 fresh Moulard, Muscovy, or Long Island (Pekin) duck legs (5 pounds total)",
            "2 whole cloves",
            "5 (7-ounce) containers rendered duck fat",
            "Equipment: a deep-fat thermometer"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Mince and mash 4 garlic cloves to a paste with a pinch of kosher salt. Stir together paste, kosher salt (1/4 cup), thyme, quatre \u00e9pices, shallots, and bay leaves in a large bowl. Add duck legs and toss to coat, then marinate, covered and chilled, at least 1 day and up to 2 days.",
            "Wipe off marinade with paper towels.",
            "Trim off 1/4 inch from top of garlic head, then stick 2 whole cloves into head. Melt duck fat in a wide large heavy pot over low heat, then cook garlic head and duck legs, uncovered, over low heat until fat registers approximately 190\u00b0F, about 1 hour. Continue to cook duck, maintaining a temperature of 190 to 210\u00b0F, until a wooden pick slides easily into thighs, 2 to 3 hours more.",
            "Transfer duck with a slotted spoon to a large bowl (reserve garlic for another use if desired). Slowly pour duck fat through a fine-mesh sieve into a large crock or deep bowl, leaving any cloudy liquid or meat juices in bottom of pot, then pour strained fat over duck legs to cover by 1 inch. (If necessary, shorten drumstick bones 1 to 2 inches using a large heavy knife to fit legs more tightly in bowl.) Cool to room temperature, about 2 hours, then chill, covered, at least 8 hours.",
            "Just before serving, remove duck from fat (reserve fat for another use, such as frying), scraping off most of fat, then cook, skin side down, in a large heavy nonstick skillet over low heat, covered, until skin is crisp and duck is heated through, 15 to 20 minutes"
