        "instructions": [
            "In a small bowl, combine the soy sauce, vinegar, sesame oil, sugar, dried chile pepper, and scallion with 2 tablespoons water and stir to combine. Set aside.",
            "For the pancakes: Preheat the oven to 300\u00b0F. In a large bowl, combine the two flours, 1/2 teaspoon salt, the egg, seltzer, and kimchi liquid and mix well to incorporate. Add the kimchi, scallion whites, and fresh red chile pepper and stir to combine. In a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat, heat 1/2 tablespoon of the canola oil until shimmering. Ladle about 1/2 cup of the batter into the pan and cook undisturbed until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Flip the pancake and cook until the second side is golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes more. Transfer to a rimmed baking sheet and place in the oven to keep warm. Repeat with the remaining oil and batter, making six to eight 8-inch pancakes. Remove the pancakes from the oven and slice into quarters. Garnish with the scallion greens and serve with the dipping sauce.",
