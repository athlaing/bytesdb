            "2 heads garlic (3 inches wide)",
            "1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil",
            "6 (4-inch) sprigs fresh thyme",

        "instructions": [
            "Put oven rack in middle position and preheat oven to 425\u00b0F. Cut off and discard 1/2 inch from tops of garlic heads, exposing cloves. Put garlic in a pie plate with oil, herbs, salt, and pepper and cover plate tightly with a double layer of foil. Roast until garlic is golden and tender, 1 to 1 1/4 hours. When garlic is cool enough to handle, squeeze cloves into a bowl and pour oil through a fine-mesh sieve onto garlic. Mash well with a fork and season with salt.",
