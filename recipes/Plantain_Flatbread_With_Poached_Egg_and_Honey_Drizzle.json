Pour this mixture into the baking pan and bake for 25 to 30 minutes, until set and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean (or lift up the sides to check for doneness). Poach 1 or 2 eggs (depending on how many you are serving). Serve the plantain flatbread topped with the poached egg(s). Sprinkle with salt and pepper to taste, and a drizzle of honey. Garnish as desired.",
