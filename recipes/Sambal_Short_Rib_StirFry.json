        "instructions": [
            "Heat oil in a wok or large cast-iron skillet over high. Season beef with salt and pepper and cook, tossing and stirring often, until deeply browned, 8\u201310 minutes. At first meat might seem wet but it will eventually take on color and look shiny. Add onions and mushrooms and cook, tossing around, until they soften and start to take on a little color, 6\u20138 minutes. Add scallions, ginger, and garlic and cook, tossing constantly, until slightly wilted, about 2 minutes. Add sambal oelek and mirin and cook, tossing to coat, about 1 minute. Add radishes, snow peas, and broth and bring to a boil. Cook until liquid is reduced by half and meat and vegetables are glossy and saucy, about 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Serve stir-fry over rice topped with basil."
