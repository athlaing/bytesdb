        "instructions": [
            "In a saucepan heat milk, butter, and syrup just until warm (about 105\u00b0F.) and butter begins to melt and remove pan from heat. Stir in yeast and let stand until foamy, about 5 minutes.",
            "In a bowl of a standing electric mixer (or a large bowl if kneading by hand) whisk together flour and salt. In a small bowl lightly beat together whole egg, yolk, and mustard.",
            "With dough hook stir milk mixture and egg mixture into flour mixture to form a sticky dough. With dough hook knead dough 5 minutes, or until smooth and elastic (dough will be soft). (Alternatively, dough may be formed with a wooden spoon and kneaded on a floured surface with floured hands until smooth and elastic, 10 to 15 minutes.)",
            "Transfer dough to a lightly oiled large bowl and turn to coat with oil. Let dough rise, covered loosely, in a warm place 1 hour, or until doubled in bulk.",
            "Make glaze: In a small bowl with a fork stir together butter, syrup, and egg.",
            "In a small bowl with a fork stir together butter, syrup, and egg.",
            "Grease a 13- by 9-inch roasting or baking pan. Punch down dough and divide into 20 pieces. Form each piece into a smooth ball and transfer to pan. Brush rolls with about half of glaze and let rise, covered loosely with plastic wrap, in a warm place about 1 hour, or until doubled in bulk. Preheat oven to 400\u00b0F. Brush rolls with remaining glaze and sprinkle with seeds. Bake rolls in middle of oven 20 minutes, or until golden brown, and cool in pan on a rack 20 minutes. Rolls may be made 1 day ahead and kept, covered, in a cool dry place. (Alternatively, rolls may be made 2 weeks ahead and frozen in pan, wrapped well. Thaw rolls at room temperature.) Serve rolls warm or at room temperature.",
