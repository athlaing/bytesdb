        "title": "Caramelized Nectarines ",
        "ingredients": [
            "1 tablespoon unsalted butter",
            "5 large nectarines (about 1 1/2 pounds), or peaches (which must be skinned)",
            "1 tablespoon freshly squeezed lemon juice",
            "2 tablespoons muscovado or dark brown sugar"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "1. Set a strainer over a bowl and cut the nectarines into the strainer, so their juice collects in the bowl.",
            "2. Heat the butter in a non-stick skillet over medium heat. When it is hot but not smoking, add the nectarines and saut\u00e9 them until they sizzle and their juices reduce and begin to thicken, 2 to 3 minutes. Sprinkle the sugar over them and saut\u00e9 until the juices further thicken and the sugar caramelizes slightly, about 1 minute. You may want to increase the heat under the pan to medium-high. Add the lemon juice and saut\u00e9 until the juices thicken, then add any nectarine juice that collected in the bowl, and shake the pan so that all is well blended. Let the nectarines cook, shaking the pan occasionally, until the juices are very thick, which will take a minute or so. The total cooking time will be about 6 minutes.",
            "3. Transfer the nectarines to 4 warmed dessert plates, or to a warmed serving dish, let sit for about 4 minutes so they are not blistering hot when served."
