        "ingredients": [
            "2 unripe bananas",
            "2 tablespoons unsalted butter",
            "1 tablespoon vegetable oil",
            "two 6- to-8 ounce skinless flounder or orange roughy fillets",
            "1/2 teaspoon ground cumin",
            "1 large egg",
            "1/4 teaspoon salt",
            "2/3 cup finely chopped unsalted peanuts",
            "4 teaspoons fresh lime juice plus lime wedges as an accompaniment"

        "instructions": [
            "Peel the bananas and cut them lengthwise into 1/4-inch-thick slices. In a large ovenproof skillet heat 1 tablespoon of the butter and the oil over moderately high heat until the foam subsides, in the fat saut\u00e9 the banana slices for 1 minute on each side, or until they are golden, and transfer them with a spatula to a plate. Pat the fish dry and sprinkle it with the cumin and salt and pepper to taste. Have ready in separate shallow dishes the egg beaten with the salt and the peanuts. Dip each fillet in the egg mixture, letting the excess drip off, and dredge it in the peanuts. To the skillet add the remaining 1 tablespoon butter, heat it over moderately high heat until the foam subsides, and in it saut\u00e9 the fillets for 3 minutes. Turn the fillets, top them with the banana slices, and saut\u00e9 them for 2 minutes more. Drizzle the fish with the lime juice, transfer the skillet to the middle of a preheated 450\u00b0F. oven, and bake the fish for 5 minutes. Transfer the fillets with a spatula to 2 heated plates and serve them with the lime wedges."
