            "4 large Yukon Gold potatoes (about 1 1/2 pounds), peeled, cut into 1/2\" cubes",
            "1 1/2 cups half-and-half",
            "4 tablespoons (1/2 stick) unsalted butter",

        "instructions": [
            "Combine potatoes, half-and-half, and butter in a large saucepan; season with salt. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer very gently, stirring occasionally, until potatoes are tender (the tip of a paring knife meets no resistance) and sauce is thick, 25-35 minutes. Season with salt; stir in most of the chives. Top with remaining chives before serving.",
