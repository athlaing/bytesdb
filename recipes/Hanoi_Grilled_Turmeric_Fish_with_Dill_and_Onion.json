        "instructions": [
            "Mix fish sauce, turmeric powder, garlic, ginger, shallots, dill fronds, and black pepper in a bowl. Add fish and coat evenly. Cover and refrigerate for no longer than 30 minutes, or else the fish will get too salty as you prepare the rest of the recipe.",
            "Heat a little bit of oil on high heat in a pan/skillet and saut\u00e9 onions until lightly golden. Add 1/3 bunch of fresh dill and two sliced scallions stalks to the party. Saut\u00e9 for an additional 1\u20132 minutes. Plate the onions, scallions, and dill on a serving platter.Remove fish from bowl, drain, and dispose of marinade. Pat dry excess marinade with paper towels so the sugar in the fish sauce doesn\u2019t burn the fish.In the same pan used to cook the onions, heat a little more oil on medium-high heat. Pan-fry the fish for 3\u20134 minutes, or until both sides are evenly browned. If you have delicious skin-on fish, give some extra cooking love to that skin, which should turn nice and crispy before you flip it.Plate the fish on saut\u00e9ed onions, scallions, and dill. Garnish with remaining fresh dill and scallions, cucumber, Pickled Red Onions, and peanuts.Serve immediately with sides of vermicelli noodles, Coco Rico Vietnamese Fish Sauce, and butter lettuce. Wrap everything, eat everything in a bowl, or whatever combination makes you happy. (I and many Vietnamese especially like it with \u201cMam Nem\u201d, a fermented fish and pineapple dipping sauce\u2014don\u2019t knock it til you try it!) Enjoy one of my favoritest dishes evaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaar!",
