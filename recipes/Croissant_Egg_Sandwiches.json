            "16 paper-thin slices Genoa salami (4 inches in diameter; 1/4 lb)",
            "4 croissants, halved horizontally",
            "8 large eggs",
            "3/4 cup whole milk",
            "1/4 cup whipped cream cheese",
            "1/2 teaspoon salt",
            "1/4 teaspoon black pepper",

        "instructions": [
            "Put oven rack in middle position and preheat oven to 325\u00b0F.",
            "Arrange salami slices in 1 layer on a large baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Bake until edges are crisp and beginning to curl, 10 to 12 minutes.",
            "Transfer salami to a rack to cool, arranging it in 1 layer. (Slices will crisp as they cool.) Leave oven on and discard parchment paper.",
            "Arrange croissants, cut sides up, on same baking sheet and toast in oven until just golden, 3 to 5 minutes.",
            "While croissants toast, whisk together eggs, milk, cream cheese, salt, and pepper until eggs are combined well (cream cheese won't blend into egg mixture completely).",
            "Heat oil in a 12-inch nonstick skillet over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking. Pour in egg mixture and cook, scraping up cooked egg with a heatproof rubber spatula and letting raw egg run underneath, until egg is set, about 3 minutes. Season eggs with pepper.",
            "Assemble croissant sandwiches with arugula, eggs, and crisped salami."
