In small bowl, stir together soy sauce, vinegar, ginger, and cilantro. Set aside. Prepare grill for cooking: If using charcoal grill, open vents on bottom, then light charcoal. Charcoal fire is medium-hot when you can hold your hand 5 inches above rack for 4 to 5 seconds. If using gas grill, preheat burners on high with hood closed 10 minutes, then turn down to moderately high. Using electric spice grinder, pulse coriander seeds 2 to 3 times to crack. (Alternatively, place seeds on cutting board and crush lightly with small saut pan, using gentle rocking motion.) In large bowl, combine shrimp and scallions. Drizzle with oil and toss to coat. Sprinkle with coriander, salt, and pepper and toss to coat. Thread shrimp and scallions onto skewers. Grill, turning once, until just cooked through, about 3 to 4 minutes per side. Arrange on platter and serve with dipping sauces.",
