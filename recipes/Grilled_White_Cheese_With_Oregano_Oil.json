        "title": "Grilled White Cheese With Oregano Oil ",
        "ingredients": [
            "1/2 lb Haloumi cheese, cut into 12 rectangular blocks",
            "2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil",
            "1 teaspoon dried oregano, crumbled",
            "6 (6- to 8-inch) wooden skewers"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Thread 2 blocks of cheese lengthwise onto each skewer, then cover skewers with cold water and soak 1 hour.",
            "Stir together oil and oregano in a 13- by 9-inch shallow dish.",
            "While cheese soaks, prepare grill for cooking. If using a charcoal grill, open vents on bottom of grill, then light charcoal. Charcoal fire is medium-hot when you can hold your hand 5 inches above rack for 3 to 4 seconds. If using a gas grill, preheat burners on high, covered, 10 minutes, then reduce heat to moderately high.",
            "Drain cheese skewers on paper towels and pat dry, then grill, covered only if using a gas grill, on a well-oiled grill rack, turning (use a metal spatula to scrape under cheese to loosen before turning each time), until evenly browned, 3 to 7 minutes total.",
            "Add cheese skewers to oregano oil and turn to coat."
