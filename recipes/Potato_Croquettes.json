        "ingredients": [
            "6 medium russet (baking) potatoes (2 1/2 pounds), peeled and quartered",
            "1/2 pound mozzarella, chopped",
            "1/4 cup grated parmesan",
            "1 tablespoon onion salt",
            "1/4 cup chopped parsley",
            "3 large eggs",
            "1 cup fine dry bread crumbs",
            "About 2 1/2 cups olive oil"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Generously cover potatoes with salted cold water (2 teaspoon for 4 quarts) in a large pot, then simmer until tender, about 15 minutes. Drain potatoes and chill in a large bowl until cool, about 45 minutes.",
            "Mash potatoes, then stir in cheeses, onion salt, parsley, 1/2 teaspoon pepper, and salt to taste. Stir in 1 egg.",
            "Form potato mixture into 24 oblong croquettes (about a scant 1/4 cup each). Lightly beat remaining 2 eggs in a shallow bowl and put bread crumbs in another shallow bowl. Dip 1 croquette into egg, letting excess drip off, then roll in bread crumbs to coat. Transfer to a parchment-paper-lined baking sheet. Repeat with remaining croquettes.",
            "Heat 1/2 inch oil in a 12-inch heavy skillet over medium-high heat until it shimmers. Fry croquettes in batches, turning occasionally, until golden brown, 4 to 5 minutes per batch. Transfer to paper towels to drain. Serve immediately."
