        "instructions": [
            "Prepare a grill for medium-high heat. Toss beans with 2 Tbsp. oil in a large bowl; season with salt. Place beans on grill and cook, turning occasionally, until tender and lightly charred, 6\u20138 minutes.",
            "Meanwhile, place a small skillet on grill; pour in 2 Tbsp. oil. Cook half of tomatoes, shaking skillet occasionally, until beginning to burst, about 3 minutes.",
            "Oil grate. Season steaks with salt and coat with paprika, packing on more if needed. Drizzle with 2 Tbsp. oil. Grill steaks until lightly charred and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part registers 120\u00b0F, about 4 minutes per side for medium-rare. Transfer to a cutting board and let rest 10 minutes before slicing against the grain.",
            "Halve remaining tomatoes and toss with chile, shallot, garlic, vinegar, grilled tomatoes, grilled beans, and 3 Tbsp. oil in a large bowl. Add basil, season with salt, and toss again. Combine steak and tomato mixture on a platter; drizzle with oil."
