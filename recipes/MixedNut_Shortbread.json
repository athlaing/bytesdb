        "ingredients": [
            "1 stick (1/2 cup) unsalted butter, softened",
            "1/3 cup plus 1 tablespoon sugar",
            "1/2 teaspoon vanilla",
            "1 cup all-purpose flour",
            "3/4 cup salted and roasted mixed cocktail nuts, coarsely chopped"

        "instructions": [
            "Put oven rack in middle position and preheat oven to 375\u00b0F. Stir together butter and 1/3 cup sugar in a medium bowl with a wooden spoon until combined well. Stir in vanilla, then add flour and mix with your hands just until a dough forms. Transfer dough to a lightly greased baking sheet and spread evenly with your fingers to form an 8-inch square. Sprinkle nuts evenly over dough, pressing down to help them adhere. Sprinkle remaining tablespoon sugar over nuts and bake until shortbread is deep golden, 20 to 25 minutes. Cool on baking sheet on a rack, 10 minutes. Cut into 18 (roughly 3- by 1 1/2-inch) bars.",
