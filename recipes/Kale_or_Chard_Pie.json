        "ingredients": [
            "2 tablespoons butter, plus more as needed",
            "About 8 large kale or chard leaves, rinsed well and thinly sliced",
            "1 onion, sliced",
            "Salt and pepper",
            "1/4 cup chopped mixed fresh herbs (like parsley, thyme, chervil, and/or chives)",
            "6 eggs",
            "1 cup whole-milk yogurt or sour cream",
            "3 tablespoons mayonnaise",
            "1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour",
            "1/2 teaspoon baking powder"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Heat the oven to 375\u00b0F. Melt the butter in a large skillet, preferably nonstick, over medium heat. After a minute, add the kale and onion. Sprinkle with salt and pepper and cook, stirring occasionally, until the leaves are quite tender, about 10 minutes; do not brown. Remove from the heat, add the herbs, then taste and adjust the seasoning.",
            "Meanwhile, hard-boil 3 of the eggs; shell and coarsely chop them. Add to the cooked kale and let cool while you make the batter.",
            "Whisk together the yogurt, mayonnaise, and the remaining 3 eggs in a large bowl until smooth. Add the flour and baking powder and mix until completely incorporated. Lightly butter a 12 \u00d7 9-inch or comparable ceramic or glass baking dish. Spread half the batter over the bottom, then top with the kale filling; spread the remaining batter over the kale, using your fingers or a rubber spatula to make sure there are no gaps in the top layer.",
            "Bake for 45 minutes, until the crust is shiny and golden brown. Let the pie cool for at least 15 minutes before slicing it into as many squares or rectangles as you like. Serve warm or at room temperature.",
            "CABBAGE PIE An Eastern European classic: Replace the kale with 1 head Savoy or green cabbage, cored and thinly sliced, and the mixed herbs with 2/3 cup chopped fresh dill.",

            "MUSHROOM AND KASHA PIE Meaty in flavor and texture and can be made with almost any cooked grain, including wheat and rye berries: Substitute 3 cups chopped or sliced mushrooms for the kale, and add 1 cup cooked kasha to the mushroom mixture along with the herbs.",
