            "2 cups heavy cream",
            "1 1/4 teaspoons ground cinnamon",
            "1/4 teaspoon ground cloves",

            "1. Preheat the oven to 375\u00b0F.",
            "2. Whisk together the cream, cinnamon, cloves, and nutmeg until smooth.",
            "3. In a 10-inch square baking dish, arrange an even layer of sweet potatoes. Drizzle with a few tablespoons of the cream mixture and season with salt and pepper. Repeat with the remaining potatoes and cream, seasoning with salt and pepper, to form 8 to 10 layers. Press down on the layers to totally submerge the sweet potatoes in the cream mixture.",
