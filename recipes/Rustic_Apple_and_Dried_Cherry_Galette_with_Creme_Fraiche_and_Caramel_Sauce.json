            "Mix flour and salt in processor. Add butter and cut in using on/off turns until mixture resembles coarse meal. Add 3 tablespoons ice water and process until moist clumps form, adding more water by teaspoonfuls if dough is dry. Gather dough into ball; flatten into disk. Wrap in plastic and chill 30 minutes. (Can be made 2 days ahead. Soften slightly at room temperature before rolling out.)",

Saut\u00e9 until apples are golden and begin to soften, about 8 minutes. Add dried cherries and cinnamon and stir 30 seconds. Remove from heat and cool completely.",

            "Preheat oven to 350\u00b0F. Roll out dough on floured surface to 12-inch round. Using 9-inch-diameter tart pan bottom as aid, transfer dough to rimless baking sheet. Arrange apple mixture atop dough, leaving 3-inch border. Fold edge of dough over apple mixture, pinching to seal any cracks in dough. Sprinkle remaining 1 tablespoon sugar over apple mixture and dough edge. Bake galette 15 minutes. Increase oven temperature to 375\u00b0F. Continue to bake galette until crust is light golden around edges and apples are tender, about 35 minutes longer. Using tart pan bottom as aid, transfer galette to rack; cool 15 minutes. Serve warm with Cr\u00e8me Fra\u00eeche and Caramel Sauce.",
