        "ingredients": [
            "2 (1 1/2-inch-thick) T-bone steaks (3 pounds total), flaps cut off if necessary, at room temperature 30 minutes",
            "1 1/2 to 2 teaspoons fine sea salt",
            "1 teaspoon coarsely ground black pepper",
            "an instant-read thermometer"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Prepare grill for cooking over medium-hot charcoal (moderate heat for gas). (If using a charcoal grill, open vents on bottom of grill, then light charcoal. When Charcoal turns grayish white (about 15 minutes from lighting), hold your hand 5 inches above grill rack to determine heat for charcoal as follows: Hot: When you can hold your hand there for 1 to 2 seconds; Medium-hot: 3 to 4 seconds; Low: 5 to 6 seconds. If using a gas grill, preheat burners on high, covered, 10 minutes, then, if necessary, reduce to heat specified in recipe.) Pat steaks dry and sprinkle all over with sea salt and pepper. Grill steaks on lightly oiled grill rack, covered only if using a gas grill, turning over once, until thermometer inserted horizontally 2 inches into meat (do not touch bone) registers about 120\u00b0F for rare, 9 to 11 minutes. Transfer steaks to a cutting board and let stand, uncovered, 10 minutes before slicing. (Internal temperature will rise to 125-128\u00b0F while steaks stand.)",
