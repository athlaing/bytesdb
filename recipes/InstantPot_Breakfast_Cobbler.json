            "1 pear, diced",
            "1 apple, diced",
            "1 plum, diced",
            "2 tbsp (30 ml) local honey",
            "3 tbsp (45 ml) coconut oil",
            "1/2 tsp ground cinnamon",
            "1/4 cup (19 g) unsweetened shredded coconut",
            "1/4 cup (30 g) pecan pieces",
            "2 tbsp (20 g) sunflower seeds (salted and roasted will work)",
            "Optional garnish: Coconut whipped cream"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Place your cut fruit into the stainless steel bowl of your Instant Pot. Spoon in the honey and coconut oil, sprinkle the cinnamon, secure the lid and close off the pressure valve. Press the Steam button; the display will read 10 minutes. Allow the fruit to cook, and quick-release the pressure once the cooking cycle has completed. Remove the lid once safe to do so and transfer the cooked fruit with a slotted spoon or skimmer into a serving bowl. Now place the coconut, pecans, and sunflower seeds into the residual liquid and press the Saut\u00e9 button. Allow the contents to cook, shifting them regularly so they do not burn. Once they are nicely browned and toasted, about 5 minutes or so, remove them and top your cooked fruit. Serve warm and topped with coconut whipped cream if desired."
