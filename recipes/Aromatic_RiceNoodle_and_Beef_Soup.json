            "Discard any dry outer leaves from lemongrass and coarsely chop bottom third of stalk. Heat oils in a 5-qt. heavy pot over moderate heat until hot but not smoking, then cook shallot and chiles, stirring, until dark brown (be careful not to burn), 3 to 4 minutes. Add lemongrass and galangal and cook, stirring, 1 minute. Add broth, fish sauce, star anise, cinnamon stick, salt, and white pepper and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer 20 minutes. Pour through a fine sieve into another pot and discard solids. Add tomatoes, scallions, and lime juice and simmer until tomatoes are softened, about 10 minutes. Bring a large pot of water to a boil for noodles. Trim fat from steak and season with salt and pepper. Heat a well-seasoned ridged grill pan over moderately high heat until hot, then grill steak 4 to 5 minutes on each side for rare. Let stand 5 minutes before slicing very thin. Meanwhile, cook noodles in boiling water until tender, about 6 minutes, and drain. Divide among 4 large soup bowls and top with spinach and steak. Ladle soup over and sprinkle with mint.",
