Add tomatoes and reserved juice and cook over moderate heat, stirring occasionally, 40 minutes, or until thickened. Stir in vinegar, sugar, and salt and pepper to taste. Remove skillet from heat and cool sauce. Tomato sauce may be made 1 day ahead and chilled, covered.",

Fill each pasta shell with about 1 tablespoon cheese mixture and arrange shells in one layer, cheese sides up, over sauce. Pour remaining tomato sauce over shells and sprinkle with remaining 1/4 cup mozzarella. Bake shells in middle of oven 30 minutes, or until sauce is bubbling and cheese is melted."
