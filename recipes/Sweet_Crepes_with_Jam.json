            "Combine milk, eggs, club soda, sugar, dark rum, vanilla extract and salt in large bowl. Whisk until sugar dissolves. Gradually sift in flour, whisking until blended. Stir in melted butter and lemon peel. Preheat oven to 250\u00b0F. Brush 6- to 7-inch-diameter cr\u00eape pan lightly with vegetable oil and heat over medium-high heat. Pour scant 1/4 cup batter into pan, tilting to coat bottom thinly; return any excess batter to bowl. Cook until cr\u00eape is brown, about 2 minutes. Carefully turn over and cook until cr\u00eape is light brown in spots, about 30 seconds. Transfer cr\u00eape to baking sheet. Place in oven. Repeat with remaining batter, lightly brushing pan with vegetable oil before pouring in batter for each cr\u00eape. Spread 1 tablespoon jam over each cr\u00eape; fold cr\u00eape in half, then fold in half again, forming triangle. Sprinkle with powdered sugar and serve warm.",
