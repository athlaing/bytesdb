        "ingredients": [
            "2 tablespoons olive or grape seed oil",
            "1 large onion, sliced 1/4 inch thick or thinner",
            "1/2 cup garlic cloves, chopped",
            "2 red bell peppers, cored, seeded, and cut lengthwise into 1/2-inch-wide strips",
            "1 1/2 pounds honeycomb beef tripe, purchased partially cooked, cut into 1-inch squares",
            "1 large, ripe tomato, cored and coarsely chopped",
            "1 tablespoon tomato paste",
            "Bouquet garni of 5 or 6 sprigs thyme, 1 bay leaf, and 6 to 8 sprigs flat-leaf parsley wrapped in a cheesecloth sachet or tied with kitchen twine",
            "Kosher salt and freshly ground",
            "1/4 cup homemade coarse fresh bread crumbs"

        "instructions": [
            "Heat a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the oil and warm it until it ripples. Add the onion, garlic, and bell peppers, stir, reduce the heat to medium, and cook, stirring occasionally, for 10 to 15 minutes, or until the vegetables have softened and begun to turn golden. Stir in the tripe, tomato, and tomato paste and add the bouquet garni and enough water to just barely cover. Bring to a boil over high heat, decrease the heat to maintain a simmer, and cook uncovered for 1 hour, or until the tripe is tender when pierced with a fork (or try biting into a piece). Remove from the heat. If the tripe and vegetables have given off a lot of liquid and the sauce seems thin, strain the contents of the pan and set the tripe and vegetables aside. Return the liquid to the pan, bring to a boil, and cook until reduced to 1 1/2 cups. Stir the tripe and vegetables into the reduced sauce and season with salt and pepper. Decrease the heat to medium to reheat the tripe and thicken the sauce further. The dish should be stewlike, neither soupy nor dry. (At this point, the dish can be cooled, covered, and refrigerated for up to 3 days. Reheat before continuing.) To serve, preheat the broiler. Transfer the tripe, vegetables, and sauce to a broiler-proof shallow gratin dish or 4 individual baking dishes. Scatter the bread crumbs evenly on top, and broil until golden.",
