            "For crust: Whisk flour, sugar, and 1 teaspoon coarse salt in large bowl to blend. Add butter and rub in with fingertips until coarse meal forms. Stir cream and egg yolk in small bowl until blended; drizzle over flour mixture. Stir until dough comes together in moist clumps. Gather dough into ball; flatten into disk. Wrap and chill at least 1 hour and up to 1 day. Roll out dough on floured surface to 12-inch round. Transfer to 9-inch tart pan with removable bottom. Cut off all but 1/2-inch overhang. Fold overhang in and press, forming double-thick sides. Pierce bottom of crust with fork; chill 30 minutes. Preheat oven to 350\u00b0F. Line crust with foil and fill with dried beans or pie weights. Bake until sides of crust are set, about 20 minutes. Remove foil with beans and bake until crust is golden brown, 12 to 15 minutes longer. Cool crust completely.",
