            "1 cup all-purpose flour",
            "4 teaspoons baking powder",
            "1 tablespoon sugar",
            "3 to 4 ears corn",
            "3/4 cup whole milk",
            "2 large eggs",
            "2 tablespoons vegetable oil",
            "1 stick unsalted butter, melted and cooled",
            "Accompaniment: pure maple syrup, or salsa and sour cream"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Whisk together flour, baking powder, sugar, and 1 teaspoon salt in a medium bowl.",
            "Cut enough kernels from cobs to measure 2 cups. Using back of a knife, scrape pulp from cobs and transfer to a blender with milk and 1/2 cup corn. Pur\u00e9e until smooth, then strain through a sieve into another medium bowl, pressing on and then discarding solids. Whisk in eggs, oil, and butter.",
            "Add to flour mixture with remaining 1 1/2 cups corn and whisk until just combined.",
            "Heat a griddle or heavy skillet over medium heat until hot, then lightly brush with oil. Working in batches, pour 1/3 cup batter per pancake onto griddle and cook until bubbles appear on surface and undersides are golden-brown, about 2 minutes. Flip with a spatula and cook until undersides are golden-brown, about 1 minute more. (Reduce heat if pancakes brown too quickly.) Lightly oil griddle between batches if necessary."
