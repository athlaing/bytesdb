            "1 1/2 pounds medium carrots, with green tops, if available",
            "1 tablespoon plus 2 teaspoons olive oil",
            "1/2 teaspoon sugar",
            "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt",
            "1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper",
            "1 1/2 teaspoons fennel seeds",

        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Preheat oven to 425\u00b0F. Trim carrot tops and coarsely chop. Measure out 2 Tbsp. carrot tops and set aside; reserve any remaining carrot tops for another use. Peel carrots, slice in half lengthwise, then cut into 2\" pieces.",
            "Toss carrots with oil, sugar, salt, and pepper on a rimmed baking sheet. Arrange in a single layer and roast carrots, stirring halfway through, until tender and lightly caramelized, 25\u201335 minutes.",
            "Meanwhile, lightly crush fennel seeds using a mortar and pestle or the bottom of a heavy pan. Melt butter in a medium skillet over medium heat, then stir in crushed seeds. Cook, stirring occasionally, until foam subsides and butter becomes fragrant, nutty, and golden brown, 3\u20135 minutes. Transfer butter mixture to a medium bowl.",
            "Once carrots are roasted, add them to butter mixture and toss to coat. Add lemon juice and toss to coat. Serve carrots topped with reserved carrot tops."
