            "1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour",
            "1/4 teaspoon salt",
            "1 1/2 sticks (3/4 cup) unsalted butter, softened",
            "1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons granulated sugar",
            "2 teaspoons heavy cream",

        "instructions": [
            "Stir together flour and salt in a bowl. Beat together butter and granulated sugar with an electric mixer at medium-high speed in a large bowl until pale and fluffy. Reduce speed to low, then add flour mixture in 3 batches, mixing, and continue to mix until batter just comes together in clumps. Gather clumps to form a dough, then press dough with lightly floured hands into a smooth 1 1/4-inch-thick log on a very lightly floured work surface. Chill, wrapped in plastic wrap, at least 1 hour. Put oven racks in upper and lower thirds of oven and preheat oven to 350\u00b0F. Line 2 large baking sheets with parchment paper. Cut chilled log crosswise into 1/4-inch-thick slices and arrange slices about 1/2 inch apart on baking sheets. Brush tops of cookies lightly with cream, then sprinkle generously with turbinado sugar. Bake cookies, switching position of sheets halfway through baking, until edges are pale golden, 12 to 15 minutes total. Cool on sheets on racks.",
