            "Preheat oven to 425\u00b0F. Roast pork until beginning to brown, 25-30 minutes. Reduce heat to 350\u00b0F and roast until a thermometer inserted in the thickest part registers 145\u00b0F, 25-35 minutes longer, depending on thickness of roast.",

Remove from heat and transfer to a large bowl. Add onion, parsley, and half of remaining vinaigrette; season with salt and pepper and toss to combine.",
            "Slice pork. Serve with farro salad. Pass remaining vinaigrette alongside.",
            "DO AHEAD: Farro can be cooked 2 days ahead. Let cool, cover, and chill. Reheat before using."
