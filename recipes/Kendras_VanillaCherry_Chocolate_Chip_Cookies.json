            "1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour",
            "1/2 teaspoon baking soda",
            "1/4 teaspoon coarse kosher salt",
            "1 vanilla bean",
            "1 cup (6 ounces) dried cherries",
            "8 tablespoons (1 stick) unsalted butter, room temperature",
            "1/2 cup sugar",
            "1/2 cup packed light brown sugar",
            "1 large egg",
            "1/2 cup (3 ounces) white chocolate chips",
            "1/2 cup (3 ounces) semisweet chocolate chips",
            "1/2 cup (2 1/2 ounces) chopped blanched hazelnuts or walnuts",
            "2 large baking sheets; 2 nonstick baking mats such as Silpats or parchment paper"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Position a rack in the upper third of the oven and a second rack in the lower third then preheat to 350\u00b0F. Line 2 large baking sheets with nonstick baking mats or parchment paper.",
            "In a large bowl, sift together the flour, baking soda, and salt.",
            "Using a small knife split the vanilla bean lengthwise then scrape the seeds from the pod into a small bowl and reserve both.",
            "In a small bowl, combine the scraped vanilla bean pod (not the seeds), the dried cherries, and about 1 cup boiling water. Let stand 5 minutes then drain, reserving the cherries and discarding the vanilla bean pod.",
            "In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, combine the butter, sugar, and brown sugar and beat on medium speed, scraping the bowl occasionally, until light and fluffy, about 2 minutes. Add the egg and the vanilla bean seeds and beat on medium until combined, about 1 minute. With the mixer on low, add the flour mixture in 3 batches, stirring until just combined. Add the cherries, white and semisweet chocolate chips, and the hazelnuts or walnuts and stir until just incorporated.",
            "Drop the dough by heaping tablespoons onto the prepared baking sheets, leaving about 2 inches between cookies. Bake, switching the cookies between the upper and lower racks about halfway through baking, until light golden brown and just set, 10 to 12 minutes. Cool the cookies on baking sheets for 5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely. Continue baking cookies on cooled baking sheets. DO AHEAD: The cookies can be baked ahead and stored, in an airtight container at room temperature, up to 3 days."
