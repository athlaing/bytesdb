        "title": "Wilted Chard With Shallots and Vinegar ",
        "ingredients": [
            "1 bunch Swiss chard, ribs and stems separated from leaves",
            "2 tablespoons olive oil",
            "2 large shallots, thinly sliced into rings",
            "2 garlic cloves, grated",
            "Kosher salt",
            "2 teaspoons Sherry vinegar or red wine vinegar"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Cut Swiss chard stems into very small pieces. Tear leaves into 2\" pieces and rinse well (you'll want some water still clinging to the leaves). Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high. Add chard stems, shallots, and garlic and season with salt. Cook, stirring occasionally, until vegetables are starting to soften but haven't taken on any color, about 2 minutes. Add chard leaves, season with salt, and cook, tossing occasionally, until leaves are tender and have released some liquid, about 3 minutes (stems will have a bit of crunch). Mix in vinegar; taste and season with more salt if needed.",
