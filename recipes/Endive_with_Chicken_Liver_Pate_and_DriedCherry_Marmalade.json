        "instructions": [
            "In a small bowl, combine the cherries and red wine and let sit until the cherries have softened a bit, at least one hour and up to overnight.",
            "In a medium saut\u00e9 pan over moderately low heat, warm the chicken fat or olive oil. Add the onion and saut\u00e9, stirring occasionally, until golden brown and caramelized, about 40 minutes. Increase the heat to moderately high, add the thyme or marjoram, 1 tablespoon red wine vinegar, the cherries, and the wine they soaked in. Cook until most of the liquid has evaporated, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the remaining tablespoon red wine vinegar and season with salt and pepper. Set aside to cool. DO AHEAD: The cherry marmalade can be made ahead and stored, in an airtight container in the refrigerator, up to 3 days.",
            "Make the chicken liver p\u00e2t\u00e9: Arrange a rack about 6 inches from the flame of a broiler. Place the broiler pan or a baking sheet on the rack and preheat the broiler. If using chicken fat, in a small saucepan over low heat warm the fat until melted. In a large bowl, toss together the livers, about 2 tablespoons melted chicken fat or the olive oil, salt, and pepper. Arrange the livers, in a single layer, on the preheated broiler pan or baking sheet and broil for 2 minutes. Flip the livers and continue broiling until tender when pressed and pale brown in color, about 1 minute more. Transfer the livers to a cutting board and let cool. Once the livers are cool enough to handle, coarsely chop them, making sure to leave them chunky. Transfer to a large bowl, drizzle with the remaining 2 tablespoons warmed chicken fat or olive oil, and gently toss to combine. Season with salt and pepper.",
