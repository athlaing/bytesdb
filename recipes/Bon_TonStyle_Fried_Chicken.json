            "Add chicken, making sure it is covered with marinade. Chill, covered, stirring twice, about 24 hours.",
            "Dredge and fry chicken: Heat 2 inches oil in a wide 8- to 9 1/2-quart pot over moderately high heat until a deep-fat thermometer registers 365 to 375\u00b0F. (Our pot was 12 inches wide and 5 inches deep; if you don\u2019t have that wide a pot, you can fry the chicken in two batches.) Meanwhile, whisk together all dredging ingredients in a large bowl. Drain chicken, discarding marinade. Dredge each piece of chicken in seasoned flour and put on a large baking sheet. Let stand about 10 minutes. Fry chicken, turning a few times, 20 to 25 minutes, or until golden brown, then drain on a rack.",
