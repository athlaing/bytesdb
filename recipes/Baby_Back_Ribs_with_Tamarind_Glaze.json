            "Place ribs in a large Dutch oven or other heavy pot. Add ginger, orange wedge, star anise, apple juice, salt, half of chiles, and 1/4 cup brown sugar. Pour in water just to cover pork and bring to a simmer over medium heat. Reduce heat so liquid is at a very gentle simmer, partially cover pot, and braise, turning racks a few times, until meat is fork-tender and nearly (but not quite) falling off the bones, 1 1/2\u20132 hours. Chop remaining chiles while ribs are cooking and set aside.",
            "Carefully transfer ribs to a rimmed baking sheet and let cool. Cut between ribs to create 2-rib pieces.",
            "Meanwhile, crank up the heat under the Dutch oven to high and add ketchup, vinegar, tamarind concentrate, honey, remaining 1/3 cup brown sugar, and reserved chopped chiles to braising liquid. Cook, stirring often, until glaze is thick enough to coat a spoon (it should be reduced to 1\u20131 1/2 cups), 30\u201345 minutes. Strain into a large measuring cup; discard solids. Let settle so oil rises to surface. Pour off oil into a small bowl; set aside.",
            "Salad and assembly: Prepare a grill for medium heat; oil grate. Working one at a time, dip ribs into glaze to coat. Grill ribs, turning several times, until glaze is lightly charred, about 5 minutes total. Transfer ribs to a platter; season with salt. Drizzle with remaining glaze and reserved oil. Toss cucumber, onion, chile, and lime juice in a medium bowl to combine; season with salt. Scatter salad over ribs and top with micro cilantro. Serve with lime wedges.",
