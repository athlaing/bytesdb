            "1 large fennel bulb (sometimes called anise), stalks cut off and discarded and bulb sliced lengthwise 1/2 inch thick, then cut into 1/2-inch-wide strips",
            "1 head cauliflower, cut into 1-inch-wide florets (4 to 6 cups)",
            "3 mixed bell peppers (red, orange, and yellow), cut into 1/4-inch-wide strips",
            "1 lb medium carrots, cut into 3- to 4-inch-long strips (1/4 inch thick)",
            "3 1/2 cups distilled white vinegar",
            "1 3/4 cups sugar",
            "1 3/4 cups water",
            "4 garlic cloves, halved",
            "1 tablespoon plus 1/2 teaspoon salt",

        "instructions": [
            "Add fennel, cauliflower, bell peppers, and carrots to an 8-quart pot half full of unsalted boiling water, then immediately turn off heat and let stand, uncovered, 2 minutes. Drain vegetables in a colander and spread out on a kitchen towel to cool to room temperature. Bring remaining ingredients to a boil in a 3-quart nonreactive saucepan (see cooks' note, below) over moderate heat, stirring until sugar is dissolved. Transfer pickling liquid to a 4-quart nonreactive bowl and cool to room temperature, about 30 minutes. Discard garlic (don't be alarmed if it has turned blue in reaction to the vinegar) and add vegetables to pickling liquid. Weight vegetables with a plate to keep them submerged in liquid if necessary. Chill, covered, at least 1 week.",
