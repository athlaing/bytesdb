            "16 cups water",
            "2 cups sugar",
            "2 cups coarse salt",
            "5 cloves of garlic, crushed",
            "1 tablespoon pickling spices",
            "1 fresh turkey breast, 9-11 pounds, deboned",

        "instructions": [
            "1. Combine the brine ingredients in a large pot. Bring to a boil, reduce heat and simmer, partially covered, until sugar and salt dissolve. Cool to room temperature.",
            "2. Rinse the turkey breast, discarding excess fat. Place in a deep bowl or pot, breast-side down. Pour the brine over the breast and refrigerate, loosely covered, overnight.",
            "3. Preheat oven to 350\u00b0F. Remove the turkey from the brine 30 minutes before roasting. Line a shallow roasting pan with long pieces of heavy-duty aluminum foil.",
            "4. Place turkey in the pan. Brush with 4 tablespoons of melted butter; season with pepper. Gather foil loosely on top and bake for 1 1/2 hours. Open the foil and bake for 2 1/4 hours more, basting every 30 minutes with broth and the remaining 2 tablespoons butter, until the turkey is golden brown and a meat thermometer inserted in the thickest part reads 165\u00b0F and the juices run clear. Transfer the breast to a cutting board; let rest for 15 minutes before carving. Reserve pan juices for gravy ."
