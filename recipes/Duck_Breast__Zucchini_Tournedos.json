            "3 young zucchini",
            "salt",
            "1 3/4 oz dried cep mushrooms ('champagne cork' or bouchon) or porcini",

            "For the mushroom powder, process the dried cep mushrooms until finely ground, combine them with the pepper and herbes de Proven\u00e7e. Cut the duck breasts lengthways into 3 mm (\u215b inch) wide strips. Lay out the strips of duck two by two on top of each other, alternating layers of fat and lean. Cut the zucchini into strips using a vegetable peeler. Lay the strips of zucchini on top of the duck, season with the mushroom powder and season with salt. Roll up the strips tightly to make tournedos and tie with string. Make 6 tournedos in this way. Cook over gentle heat 5 minutes each side.",
