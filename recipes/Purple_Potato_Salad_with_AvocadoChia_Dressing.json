            "1 1/2 pounds baby purple or red creamer potatoes, unpeeled, scrubbed, and quartered",
            "1 1/4 teaspoons sea salt",
            "1/2 Hass avocado, pitted, peeled, and diced",
            "2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice (from about 1 small lemon)",
            "1/2 cup freshly brewed jasmine green or white tea, at room temperature",
            "2 tablespoons plain yogurt (not Greek yogurt)",
            "1/4 cup white chia seeds",
            "1 garlic clove, peeled and minced",
            "2 green onions, green and white parts, thinly sliced on diagonal",
            "1 medium celery stalk, thinly sliced on diagonal",
            "1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh dill or cilantro"

        "instructions": [
            "Place the potatoes in a large saucepan and cover with cold water. Add 3/4 teaspoon of the salt and bring to a boil over high heat. Cover, reduce heat to medium-low, and cook until potatoes are just tender, about 10 minutes. Drain potatoes, place in a large bowl, and chill in the refrigerator. In a bowl, thoroughly mash the avocado with the lemon juice until smooth. Add the tea, yogurt, chia seeds, garlic, a few drops of hot pepper sauce, and 1/4 teaspoon of the salt and whisk to combine. Let stand for about 20 minutes. (Makes 1 1/4 cups avocado-chia dressing.) Remove the potatoes from the refrigerator. Add the green onions, celery, and the remaining 1/4 teaspoon of salt to chilled potatoes and gently toss. Smear the avocado-chia dressing onto four salad plates, creating a \"bed\" for the potato salad. Top with the potato mixture, sprinkle with dill, and serve.",
