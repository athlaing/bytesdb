        "title": "Broiled Peaches with Cookie-Crumb Topping ",
        "ingredients": [
            "2 ripe peaches (about 1 pound), peeled, pitted, and cut into 1/4-inch-thick slices",
            "2 teaspoons fresh lemon juice",
            "4 teaspoons firmly packed light brown sugar",
            "1 tablespoon unsalted butter, cut into bits",
            "2 shortbread or butter cookies, crumbled (about 1/4 cup crumbs)",
            "heavy cream as an accompaniment"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "In a bowl toss together the peaches, the lemon juice, and 1 tablespoon of the brown sugar and in a buttered flameproof baking pan large enough to hold the peaches in one layer broil the mixture about 6 inches from a preheated broiler for 5 to 7 minutes, or until the peaches are tender. In a small bowl combine the remaining 1 teaspoon brown sugar, the butter, and the cookie crumbs and sprinkle the topping over the peaches. Broil the mixture for 1 to 2 minutes, or until the topping is pale golden. Divide the mixture between 2 dishes and serve it with the cream."
