            "1 1/4 cups hazelnuts (about 5 ounces), toasted, husked, cooled",
            "2 1/3 cups all purpose flour",
            "3/4 cup sugar",
            "2 teaspoons ground cinnamon",
            "1/2 teaspoon baking powder",
            "1/2 teaspoon salt",
            "1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg",
            "1 cup (2 sticks) chilled unsalted butter, cut into 1/2-inch pieces",
            "3 large egg yolks",
            "1 tablespoon vanilla extract",

        "instructions": [
            "Preheat oven to 350\u00b0F. Butter 9-inch-diameter tart pan with removable bottom. Combine nuts and 1/3 cup flour in processor; finely chop nuts. Transfer mixture to large bowl. Add remaining 2 cups flour and next 5 ingredients to bowl; whisk to blend. Add butter. Using electric mixer at low speed, blend ingredients until coarse meal forms (this will take several minutes). Add egg yolks and vanilla. Beat until moist clumps form. Gather dough into ball. Press 1 1/2 cups (packed) dough over bottom and up sides of prepared pan; spread preserves in dough. Roll remaining dough on sheet of parchment paper to 13x10-inch rectangle. Freeze rectangle 5 minutes to firm. Cut twelve 1/2-inch-wide strips lengthwise from rectangle. Arrange 6 strips across torte, spacing evenly. Arrange 6 more strips across torte in opposite direction, forming lattice. Seal ends of strips to dough edge, trimming excess. Reserve all dough scraps to make cookies, if desired. Bake torte until crust is golden brown and preserves are bubbling thickly, about 40 minutes. Cool torte completely on rack. (Can be made 2 days ahead. Cover with foil; store at room temperature.) Push bottom of pan up to free torte from pan. Sift powdered sugar over edge of torte, if desired, and serve.",
