        "instructions": [
            "Preheat oven to 400\u00b0. If using English cucumbers, split lengthwise and remove seeds (leave other varieties whole). Arrange cucumbers on a parchment paper-lined baking sheet. (If using English cucumbers, arrange cut side down.) Brush with melted butter. Roast cucumbers until crisp-tender, about 15 minutes. Transfer cucumbers to a paper towel-lined plate; chill until cold.",
            "Cut Japanese or Persian cucumbers lengthwise in half. Cut hothouse cucumber halves lengthwise in half. Slice crosswise into 1/4 inch-thick pieces. Whisk labneh and next 5 ingredients in a large bowl. Stir in sliced cucumbers and 1 tablespoon lemon juice. Season filling to taste with salt, pepper, and more lemon juice, if desired.",
            "Brush cut sides of focaccia or rolls with olive oil; place on a baking sheet and toast in a 400\u00b0 oven until just crispy and lightly browned, 3-5 minutes. Divide filling among focaccia bottoms, cover with tops, and cut each into 4 sandwiches (or divide filling among rolls)."
