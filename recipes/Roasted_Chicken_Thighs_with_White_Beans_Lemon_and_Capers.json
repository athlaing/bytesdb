Spread 1 tsp. mustard on skin of each chicken thigh and nestle, skin side up, into beans and capers. Arrange lemon slices under and around chicken and add enough water (about 1/3 cup) to come up sides of chicken by 1/2\". Drizzle chicken with oil and season whole dish with salt and pepper.",
            "Roast chicken, stirring and shaking dish halfway through, until skin is browned and an instant-read thermometer inserted into thickest part of chicken registers 165\u00b0F, about 35 minutes. If chicken skin starts to burn, move pan to a lower rack to finish cooking.",
