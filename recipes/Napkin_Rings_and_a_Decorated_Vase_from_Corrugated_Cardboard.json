            "To make a napkin ring for each guest Cut a strip of corrugated cardboard measuring 2 inches across the ridges and 10 inches down. This will create a natural roll. If available, use an empty paper towel roll as a form for making the rings. Roll the length of corrugated cardboard to form a ring, securing it inconspicuously in a couple of places with tape. Wrap 2 or 3 strands of raffia around the middle of the napkin ring several times, and then double knot it. Cut the ends so they are 1 inch long. If using dried flowers, cut the stems so they are 1\u00bd inches long and slide them through the raffia to secure them. If using fresh flowers, wait until 1 hour before guests arrive to trim the stems and attach them to the napkin rings.",
