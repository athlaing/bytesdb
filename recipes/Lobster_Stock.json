In an 8-quart heavy kettle heat oil over moderate heat until hot but not smoking and brown lobster shells and heads, mashing with a wooden spoon to help break up, about 15 minutes. Stir in carrot, onion, tomato paste, and wine and simmer until most of wine is evaporated. Add water and simmer until liquid is reduced to about 4 cups, about 1\u2022 hours. Pour stock through a fine sieve into a heat proof bowl. Stock may be made 3 days ahead and cooled, uncovered, before being chilled, covered. Stock keeps, frozen, 3 months."
