        "title": "Vidalia Onion Fritters ",
        "ingredients": [
            "1 1/3 cups all-purpose flour, or more if needed",
            "2 teaspoons baking powder",
            "Coarse (kosher) salt, to taste",
            "2 to 2 1/2 cups milk",
            "2 large eggs",
            "1/2 teaspoon white wine vinegar",
            "1/4 teaspoon Tabasco sauce or chili-garlic sauce (sambal oelek)",
            "2 large Vidalia onions, sliced lengthwise (top to bottom)",
            "Canola or other vegetable oil, for deep-frying",
            "Tamarind Dipping Sauce , for serving"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "1. Place 1 3/4 cups flour, the baking powder, and salt in a large bowl and whisk to mix.",
            "2. Place 2 cups of the milk, the eggs, vinegar, and hot sauce in another bowl and whisk until blended, then pour into the flour mixture and whisk until just blended; do not overmix. Stir in the sliced onions and let the batter rest for 30 minutes. It should be slightly thicker than heavy cream. If it isn't, sprinkle in a little more flour. If it's too thick, add a little more milk. The batter should look somewhat free-form, not doughy.",
            "3. Preheat the oven to its lowest setting.",
            "4. Pour vegetable oil to a depth of 4 inches into a large, heavy saucepan and heat to 375\u00b0F on a deep-fry thermometer. Drop the onion fritter batter into the hot oil by the tablespoonful, a few at a time, and fry, turning once, until the fritters are golden brown on both sides, about 3 minutes in all. The fritters will have an irregular, spiderlike look, with a few loose pieces of onion escaping here and there. Check a fritter by breaking it open to see if the center Is cooked; it it still seems unset, cook 1 minute more. Drain on paper towels. Place the fritters in the oven to keep warm while you finish frying them all. Serve on a doily-lined platter or in a lined woven basket accompanied by the dipping sauce in one or more bowls."
