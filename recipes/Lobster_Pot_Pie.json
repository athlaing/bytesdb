        "title": "Lobster Pot Pie ",
        "ingredients": [
            "4 cups cooked lobster meat, cut in chunks (from four 1 1/4-pound lobsters)",
            "3 tablespoons butter",
            "3 tablespoons all-purpose flour",
            "3 cups heavy cream",
            "1/2 cup medium-dry sherry",
            "1/2 teaspoon paprika",
            "Salt and freshly ground black pepper",
            "1 1/2 cups crushed Ritz cracker crumbs (about 1 sleeve of crackers)",
            "3 tablespoons butter, melted",
            "1/2 teaspoon paprika"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Divide the lobster meat into four shallow 8-ounce ramekins or gratin dishes, or place in a 1 1/2-quart shallow baking dish.",
            "In a large saucepan, melt the butter over medium-high heat. Add the flour and cook, whisking, until bubbly, about 1 minute. Add the cream and sherry, bring just to the boil, and cook, whisking, until the mixture is thick and bubbly. Season with the paprika and with salt and pepper to taste. Pour the sauce over the lobster in the dishes. The sauce will thicken as it cools.",
            "For the topping, toss the cracker crumbs with the melted butter and paprika until well mixed. (The pies and topping can be made up to several hours ahead to this point and refrigerated.)",
            "Preheat the oven to 425\u00b0F. Sprinkle the crumbs evenly over the lobster mixture. Bake, uncovered, in the preheated oven until the sauce is bubbly and the crumbs are deep golden brown, 10 to 15 minutes for ramekins, 15 to 20 minutes for a large baking dish."
