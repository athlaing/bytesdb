Place on foil-lined pan and broil until sauce caramelizes, 3 or 4 minutes. Toss asparagus with oil, salt, and pepper. Heat a saut\u00e9 pan (no oil) over high heat, 7 minutes. Add asparagus; saut\u00e9 all sides. Arrange asparagus on a plate. Top with bass, drizzle with reserved marinade, garnish with chives.
