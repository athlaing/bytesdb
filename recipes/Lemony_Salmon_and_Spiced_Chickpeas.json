        "ingredients": [
            "1 lemon, thinly sliced, seeds removed",
            "1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for drizzling",
            "1 (1 1/2-lb.) salmon fillet, preferably skin-on",
            "1/2 tsp. kosher salt, plus more",
            "Freshly ground black pepper",
            "1 (15-oz.) can chickpeas, rinsed, patted dry",
            "1 garlic clove, finely chopped",
            "2 tsp. za\u2019atar",
            "1 tsp. fresh lemon juice",
            "4 cups baby arugula or baby spinach",
            "4 radishes, trimmed, thinly sliced",
            "Flaky sea salt"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Place a rack in lower third of oven; preheat to 300\u00b0F. Toss lemon slices in a large bowl with a drizzle of oil. Arrange slices in an even layer on a rimmed baking sheet. Set salmon on lemons. Season salmon all over with kosher salt and pepper, then drizzle and rub with some oil. Roast until salmon is just barely opaque in the middle, 12\u201317 minutes, depending on thickness. If you like your salmon well-done, cook it a few minutes longer, but keep in mind that you risk the chance it will dry out. Let salmon cool, then flake into medium-size pieces with a fork.",
            "Meanwhile, bring chickpeas, garlic, za\u2019atar, and remaining 1/2 cup oil to a bare simmer in a small skillet over medium-low heat. Cook, stirring occasionally and reducing heat if needed, 10 minutes. Stir in 1/2 tsp. kosher salt (less if your za\u2019atar is salty) and remove skillet from heat.",
            "Using a slotted spoon, transfer chickpeas to a medium bowl, leaving oil behind. Whisk lemon juice into oil; taste dressing and season with more kosher salt and a few grinds of pepper if needed.",
            "Toss arugula in a large bowl with 1 tsp. dressing. Divide among bowls along with radishes, chickpeas, and salmon (and lemons if desired); drizzle with more dressing. Sprinkle with sea salt and more pepper."
