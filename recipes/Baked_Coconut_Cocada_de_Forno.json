            "8 tablespoons (1 stick) unsalted butter, at room temperature",
            "1/2 cup sugar",
            "3 whole eggs",
            "1/3 cup coconut milk",
            "1/3 cup sweetened condensed milk",

        "instructions": [
            "Preheat the oven to 350\u02daF. Lightly grease a baking dish with some spray.",
            "In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, mix the butter and sugar until light and creamy at medium speed, about 5 minutes. Add the eggs, one at a time, and continue to mix. Scrape the sides of the bowl after each addition.",
            "Add the coconut milk, sweetened condensed milk, and Malibu and continue to mix at medium speed until the batter is well blended, about 1 minute. Add the coconut and mix until it is all incorporated, although the batter will look grainy.",
            "Fold the flour in with a rubber spatula. Spread the batter into the prepared baking dish. You can keep this in the refrigerator, covered with plastic wrap, up to 2 days ahead of time.",
            "Bake in the oven until the top looks golden brown, the edges are set, but the center is slightly jiggly, about 20 minutes. Remove it from the oven and let it rest for 10 minutes.",
            "Serve with a scoop of lemon sorbet."
