Pulse chickpeas, pistachios, oil, garlic, lemon zest, salt, and pepper in a food processor until coarsely chopped, about 15 seconds. Sprinkle half of cheese over top of dough, leaving a 1/2\" border. Sprinkle three-quarters of chickpea crumble over cheese. Top with onion, then tomatoes. Top with remaining cheese and chickpea crumble.

Bake tart until crust is golden brown and tomatoes are roasted and beginning to burst, 16\u201318 minutes. Top tart with basil and cut into wedges.",
