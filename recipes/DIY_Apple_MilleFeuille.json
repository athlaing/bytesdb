        "instructions": [
            "Preheat oven to 400\u00b0F. Roll out pastry on a lightly floured surface to flatten and smooth creases. Trim slightly to make clean, straight edges; cut into 16 squares or rectangles. Transfer to a parchment-lined rimmed baking sheet; brush with egg and sprinkle with sugar. Coat another sheet of parchment with nonstick spray and place, oil side down, on top of pastry; top with another rimmed baking sheet. Bake until pastry is deep golden brown and puffed, 20\u201325 minutes. Let cool.",
            "Reduce oven temperature to 350\u00b0F. Toss apples, vinegar, vanilla, salt, 1/3 cup maple syrup, and 2 tablespoons bourbon in a shallow 3-quart baking dish; dot surface with butter. Cover tightly with foil and bake until apples soften and have released their juices, 30\u201335 minutes. Remove foil, baste apples with juices, and roast until apples are very tender and curled around the edges and a thin layer of juice covers the bottom of the dish, 20\u201325 minutes.",
            "Just before serving, whisk cream and remaining 2 tablespoons sugar in a small bowl to medium peaks. Whisk in remaining 1 tablespoon bourbon.",
            "Let guests assemble individual mille-feuille, topping pastry with apples, whipped cream, and a drizzle of maple syrup.",
            "Do ahead Apples can be baked 2 hours ahead. Let cool; store tightly wrapped at room temperature. Gently reheat before using.",
