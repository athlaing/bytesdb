            "In a skillet, cook bacon over medium heat until crisp; drain on paper towel; chop fine. Drain all but 1 teaspoon bacon drippings from skillet. Heat over medium heat. Cook onion, stirring, 3 minutes. Add collards, 1/4 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper; cook, stirring occasionally, 3 minutes. Stir in bacon; turn off heat. In a bowl, combine peas, bell pepper, tomato, chives, juice, vinegar, remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt, remaining 1/4 teaspoon pepper and chile, if desired. Heat oven to 375\u00b0. Coat 4 gratin dishes with cooking spray. Divide collards evenly among gratins; make space in center of collards for eggs. Crack 1 egg and gently pour into 1 gratin; repeat with remaining eggs and gratins. Spoon 1 tablespoon milk over each egg. Bake, covered loosely with foil, until egg whites are cooked through, 10 to 15 minutes. Spoon pea salsa onto eggs; serve."
