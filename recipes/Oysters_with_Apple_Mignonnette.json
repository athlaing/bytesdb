            "6 medium oysters such as Blue Point or Belon",
            "1/2 cup apple cider or juice",
            "3 tablespoons finely chopped tart apple",
            "2 tablespoons finely chopped red bell pepper",
            "1 tablespoon finely chopped shallot",

        "instructions": [
            "Scrub oysters well. Combine oysters and apple cider in a 2-qt. saucepan and bring to a boil. Steam oysters, covered, over moderately high heat until they just open, checking occasionally after 3 minutes and transferring to a plate as they open. (Reserve steaming liquid and discard any unopened oysters.) Chill oysters, loosely covered, until cool, about 30 minutes.",
            "While oysters are chilling, pour oyster steaming liquid through a paper towel-lined sieve into a bowl to remove any grit. Stir 2 tablespoons strained liquid together with remaining ingredients and salt to taste. Discard remaining strained liquid.",
            "Remove flat half of oyster shell and loosen oyster with a sharp knife. Put oysters in rounded half of shell. Arrange on plates and spoon sauce over oysters."
