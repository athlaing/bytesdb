            "Use a julienne peeler, mandoline or spiralizer (or even a potato peeler) to create noodles from the daikon and carrots. Place in a bowl and add the mung bean sprouts and onions. Add the tofu, coriander and sesame seeds to the noodles and mix. Stir together all the sauce ingredients in a separate bowl, add more water if needed. Taste and adjust the seasoning. Pour over the vegetables and toss to combine using your hands. Make sure that every single strand is covered in dressing. Serve with a slice of lime, chopped coriander and sesame seeds on top."
