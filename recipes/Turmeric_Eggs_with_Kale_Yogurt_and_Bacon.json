            "4 slices bacon",
            "1 bunch curly kale, ribs and stems removed, leaves torn into large pieces",
            "5 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, divided",
            "Kosher salt",
            "1 cup plain Greek yogurt",
            "4 large eggs",
            "1/2 teaspoon ground turmeric",
            "Urfa pepper or other mild red pepper flakes and lime wedges (for serving)"

        "instructions": [
            "Place a rack in middle of oven and preheat to 375\u00b0F. Bake bacon on a foil-lined rimmed baking sheet until brown and crisp, 12\u201315 minutes. Tear into large pieces; reserve fat for another use. Meanwhile, spread out kale on a rimmed baking sheet and drizzle with 2 Tbsp. oil. Massage leaves with oil and season with salt. Bake, tossing halfway through, until lightly browned around edges and crisp-tender, 5\u20137 minutes. Season yogurt with salt. Divide among plates and top with bacon and kale. Heat remaining 3 Tbsp. oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high. Add eggs one at a time, shaking skillet between additions to keep them from sticking together. Cook, tilting skillet toward you and spooning oil over egg whites until whites are set, about 2 minutes. Remove skillet from heat, keeping skillet tilted, and add turmeric to oil. Baste egg whites with turmeric oil. Divide eggs among plates and drizzle turmeric oil over. Sprinkle with red pepper flakes and squeeze limes over.",
