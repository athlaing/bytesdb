            "1/4 cup sugar",
            "2 teaspoons cornstarch",
            "4 large eggs",
            "2 cups whole milk",

        "instructions": [
            "Whisk together cane syrup, sugar, cornstarch, and a pinch of salt in a large bowl, then add eggs, whisking until combined. Bring milk and cream just to a boil in a 4-quart heavy saucepan over moderately high heat, stirring occasionally, then add egg mixture in a stream, whisking constantly. Transfer custard to saucepan. Cook custard over moderately low heat, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon, until thick enough to coat back of spoon and registers 170\u00b0F on thermometer, 5 to 8 minutes (custard may look slightly curdled; do not let boil). Immediately pour custard through a fine-mesh sieve into a bowl, then stir in vanilla and cool, stirring occasionally. Chill custard, its surface covered with wax paper, until cold, at least 3 hours. Freeze half of custard in ice cream maker until almost firm, then stir together ice cream and half of pecans in a large bowl. Transfer to an airtight container and put in freezer to harden. Repeat with remaining custard and pecans.",
