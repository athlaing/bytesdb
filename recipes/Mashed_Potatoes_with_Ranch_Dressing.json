            "Whisk all ingredients in small bowl to blend. DO AHEAD: Can be made 2 days ahead. Cover and chill.",
            "For potatoes: Place potatoes in large ovenproof pot. Pour enough cold water over to cover and add 1 tablespoon coarse salt. Bring to boil over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-high and cook until potatoes are tender when pierced with knife, about 20 minutes. Drain potatoes; reserve pot. Let potatoes stand in strainer until lukewarm, about 20 minutes. Working in batches, press potatoes through potato ricer back into same pot (do not stir; potatoes should be fluffy). DO AHEAD: Potatoes can be made 2 hours ahead. Let stand at room temperature. Preheat oven to 350\u00b0F. Combine cream, milk, and butter in small saucepan; bring to simmer. Gently fold half of cream mixture into potatoes; repeat with remaining cream mixture. Fold 3/4 cup ranch dressing into potatoes; reserve remaining dressing for serving. Season potatoes to taste with more coarse salt and freshly ground black pepper. Transfer pot with mashed potatoes to oven and rewarm uncovered until potatoes are heated through, about 10 minutes for freshly made potatoes or 30 minutes if potatoes are made ahead. Transfer mashed potatoes to large serving bowl. Drizzle with remaining dressing and serve.",
