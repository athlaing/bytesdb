Sprinkle lamb with cardamom, salt and pepper. Heat oil in heavy large skillet over high heat. Add 1 lamb rack; sear until brown, turning occasionally, about 6 minutes. Transfer lamb, meat side up, to baking sheet. Repeat with second lamb rack. Roast until meat thermometer inserted into center registers 125\u00b0F for medium-rare, about 18 minutes. Let stand 5 minutes. Cut lamb between bones into chops. Bring sauce to simmer. Reduce heat to low. Add butter and mustard; whisk just until butter melts. Season with pepper. Spoon sauce onto plates. Top with sweet potatoes and lamb and serve.",
