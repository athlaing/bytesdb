        "ingredients": [
            "2 cups whole-wheat flour",
            "2 cups all-purpose flour plus additional for kneading",
            "1/2 cup toasted wheat germ",
            "2 teaspoons salt",
            "2 teaspoons sugar",
            "1 teaspoon baking soda",
            "1/2 teaspoon cream of tartar",
            "1 stick (1/2 cup) cold unsalted butter, cut into 1/2-inch cubes",
            "2 cups well-shaken buttermilk"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Put oven rack in middle position and preheat oven to 400\u00b0F. Butter a 9- by 2-inch round cake pan.",
            "Whisk together flours, wheat germ, salt, sugar, baking soda, and cream of tartar in a large bowl until combined well. Blend in butter with a pastry blender or your fingertips until mixture resembles coarse meal. Make a well in center and add buttermilk, stirring until a dough forms. Gently knead on a floured surface, adding just enough more flour to keep dough from sticking, until smooth, about 3 minutes.",
            "Transfer dough to cake pan and flatten to fill pan. With a sharp knife, cut an X (1/2 inch deep) across top of dough (5 inches long). Bake until loaf is lightly browned and sounds hollow when bottom is tapped, 30 to 40 minutes. Cool in pan on a rack 10 minutes, then turn out onto rack and cool, right side up, about 1 hour."
