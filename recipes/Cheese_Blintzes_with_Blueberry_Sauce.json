Pour 1/4 to 1/3 cup batter into pan, tilting to spread into thin, even layer. Cook until cr\u00eape begins to \"blister,\" edges curl slightly away from skillet, and underside is lightly browned, about 1 to 2 minutes. Use flexible spatula to flip cr\u00eape out of skillet and onto plate, cooked side up.",

Flip over again and place on a large plate. Repeat with remaining cr\u00eapes and filling. (Can be made up to 1 day ahead; cover and chill until ready to fry.)",
