            "Whisk orange juice, Sriracha, honey, soy sauce, 1/4 cup oil, and 1 Tbsp. lime juice in a medium bowl. Set aside half of dressing in a small bowl for serving. Add shrimp to remaining sauce and toss to coat; season lightly with salt. Let sit, tossing occasionally, 15 minutes.",
            "Meanwhile, using a paring knife, remove peel and white pith from oranges, being careful not to remove too much of the flesh; discard. Slice oranges into 1/2\"-thick rounds, then cut into 1\" pieces. Transfer to a medium bowl and add cucumbers, scallions, and remaining 1 tsp. lime juice; toss to combine. Season with salt.",
            "Heat remaining 2 Tbsp. oil in a large skillet over high. Working in batches if needed, cook shrimp until charred in spots and cooked through, about 3 minutes per side.",
            "Divide rice among bowls. Top with shrimp, citrus salad, and avocado and drizzle with reserved dressing."
