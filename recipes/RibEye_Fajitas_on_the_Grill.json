        "instructions": [
            "In a large (4-cup) measuring cup, combine the soy sauce, lime juice, Worcestershire sauce, garlic, wine, and vegetable oil to make the marinade. Put the steaks in a large, heavy-duty, self-sealing plastic bag, pour in the marinade, seal, and refrigerate for at least 4 hours or overnight.",
            "Preheat an outdoor grill; preheat the oven to 250\u00b0F. Grill the chiles and bell peppers whole until they blister and brown, turning with tongs every few minutes to ensure they roast on all sides; remove from the heat. Core and seed them, slice them lengthwise into 1/2-inch strips, and sprinkle them with lemon juice and a pinch of salt. Wrap them in aluminum foil and keep them warm in the oven until ready to serve. Wrap the tortillas in foil and put in the oven to warm with the peppers. Remove the steaks from the marinade, drain, and grill according to your preference. Grill the onion slices along with the steak, about 5 minutes per side. To serve, slice the steaks thinly; arrange on a large platter with the grilled sliced onion and the chiles and peppers. Alongside the platter, set out the warm tortillas and bowls of sour cream and guacamole. Beans \u00e0 la Charra, served in small bowls, is another classic fajita accompaniment.",
