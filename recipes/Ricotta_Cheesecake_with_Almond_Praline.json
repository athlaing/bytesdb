        "instructions": [
            "Preheat oven to 150\u00b0C (300\u00b0F). Lightly grease a 22cm round springform cake tin and line the base with non-stick baking paper. Set aside. To make the base, place the flour, sugar and butter in a food processor and process for 1 minute or until a rough dough forms. Using the back of a spoon, press the mixture into the base of the prepared tin. Bake for 30\u201335 minutes or until golden and just cooked. Set aside to cool slightly. While the base is baking, make the filling. Place the cream cheese, ricotta, sugar, lemon juice, lemon rind and vanilla in a food processor and process until smooth. Place the cornstarch and water in a small bowl and mix until smooth. Add the cornstarch mixture and the eggs to the filling and process to combine. Lightly re-grease the sides of the cake tin and pour the filling over the base, tapping gently to remove any air bubbles. Bake for 50 minutes\u20131 hour or until light golden and just set. Allow to cool in the closed oven for 50 minutes. Refrigerate for 1 hour or until chilled.",
