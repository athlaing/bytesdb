            "1 1/2 tablespoons chopped fresh rosemary leaves",
            "2 leeks (white and light-green parts only) split lengthwise and sliced (about 4 cups)",
            "2 1/2 cups low-sodium chicken broth",

        "instructions": [
            "Preheat oven to 250\u00b0F. Butter a 3-quart baking dish. Place cubed bread on a rimmed baking sheet and bake until slightly dry, 10 to 15 minutes. Raise oven temperature to 350\u00b0F. In a large saut\u00e9 pan over high heat, melt 1 tablespoon butter. Add mushrooms, and season with salt and pepper. Cook, tossing occasionally, until mushrooms have released their liquid and start to brown, 6 to 8 minutes. Scrape into a medium bowl and set aside, reserving pan. Return pan to medium heat and melt remaining 1 tablespoon butter. Add fennel and rosemary, and cook until fennel softens and starts to brown, about 5 minutes. Add leeks and cook until all the vegetables are very soft, about 5 minutes more. Return mushrooms to pan, add broth, and bring to a simmer. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Transfer vegetables to a large bowl and let cool slightly. Add cubed bread and eggs and toss until mixture is combined. Transfer bread mixture to baking dish. Bake in the center of the oven until golden brown and slightly puffed, 35 to 40 minutes (add 10 minutes if the dish has been refrigerated). Top with parsley and serve immediately.",
