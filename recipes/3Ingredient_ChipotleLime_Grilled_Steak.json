        "title": "3-Ingredient Chipotle-Lime Grilled Steak ",
        "ingredients": [
            "1 canned chipotle chile in adobo, ribs and seeds removed, plus 1 tablespoon adobo sauce",
            "1 1/2 teaspoons lime zest (from about 2 limes), divided",
            "1/3 cup fresh lime juice (from about 3 limes)",
            "2 tablespoons vegetable oil",
            "1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt, plus more",
            "1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, plus more",
            "1 1/2 pounds skirt or flank steak",
            "Lime wedges (for serving)"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Blend chile, adobo sauce, 1 tsp. lime zest, lime juice, oil, 1 1/2 tsp. salt, and 1 tsp. pepper in a blender until smooth. Place steak in a large resealable plastic bag, pour marinade over, and toss to coat. Marinate, tossing occasionally, at least 30 minutes at room temperature, or chill overnight. If chilled, let steak sit at room temperature 30 minutes. Prepare a grill or grill pan for medium-high heat. Remove steak from marinade; discard marinade. Grill steak until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of steak registers 120\u2013125\u00b0F for medium-rare, 2\u20133 minutes per side for skirt; 3\u20134 minutes per side for flank. Let rest 10 minutes before thinly slicing against the grain (to make slicing easier for skirt steak, cut into 5\u20136\" segments, then slice against the grain). Transfer to a platter and top with remaining 1/2 tsp. lime zest; season with salt and pepper. Serve with lime wedges alongside.",
