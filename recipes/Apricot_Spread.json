            "1/2 pound dried apricots, preferably California (1 1/2 cups)",
            "3/4 cup dry white wine",
            "1/2 cup water",
            "1/4 cup sugar",

        "instructions": [
            "Bring apricots, wine, water, sugar, zest, and a pinch of salt to a boil in a small heavy saucepan over medium-high heat, stirring until sugar has dissolved. Reduce heat and simmer, partially covered, stirring occasionally, until liquid is reduced and very syrupy and apricots are very soft, about 15 minutes if using California (about 45 minutes if using Turkish). (If apricots are not yet softened, pour in an additional 1/4 cup water and continue cooking.)",
            "Remove from heat. Discard zest, then stir in rum. Transfer apricot mixture to a bowl and cool slightly, stirring occasionally, about 45 minutes.",
            "Pur\u00e9e in a food processor until mixture is very smooth. Add water to pur\u00e9e if necessary to achieve a spreadable consistency.",
            "Serve at room temperature or chilled."
