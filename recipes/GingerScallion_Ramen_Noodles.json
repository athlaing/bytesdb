        "ingredients": [
            "1 (5\") piece ginger, peeled, finely chopped (about 1/3 cup)",
            "4 garlic cloves, finely chopped",
            "1 large bunch scallions, very thinly sliced, divided",
            "1/2 cup grapeseed or other neutral oil",
            "2 Tbsp. low-sodium soy sauce",
            "1 Tbsp. unseasoned rice vinegar",
            "1 tsp. toasted sesame oil",
            "1 tsp. freshly ground black pepper",
            "1/2 tsp. sugar",
            "Kosher salt",
            "4 (5-oz.) packages wavy ramen noodles, preferably fresh",
            "Toasted sesame seeds and chili oil (for serving)"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Toss ginger, garlic, and two-thirds of the scallions in a large bowl to combine. Heat grapeseed oil in a small saucepan over high until hot and shimmering but not smoking, about 2 minutes. Immediately pour hot oil over aromatics. The scallions will sizzle, turn bright green, and wilt almost immediately. Let sit 5 minutes.",
            "Mix soy sauce, vinegar, sesame oil, pepper, sugar, and remaining scallions into oil mixture; season with salt. Let sit 15 minutes for flavors to meld. Taste sauce and season with more salt if needed.",
            "Meanwhile, cook noodles according to package directions; drain.",
            "Toss noodles in a large bowl with as much or little sauce as you\u2019d like. Divide among bowls and sprinkle with sesame seeds. Serve with chili oil alongside."
