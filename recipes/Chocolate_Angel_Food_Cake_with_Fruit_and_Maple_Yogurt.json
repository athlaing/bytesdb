        "ingredients": [
            "1 1/2 cups sugar",
            "1 cup unbleached all-purpose flour",
            "1/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder",
            "1/4 teaspoon salt",
            "12 egg whites (or 1 1/2 cups prepackaged egg whites)",
            "1 teaspoon fresh lemon juice",
            "1 teaspoon vanilla extract",
            "4 cups fresh strawberries",
            "4 cups fresh raspberries",
            "1/4 cup peach nectar",
            "1 tablespoon honey",
            "1 cup plain lowfat yogurt",
            "2 tablespoons maple syrup"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Transfer the oven rack to the lowest level. Preheat oven to 325\u00b0F. Sift 1 cup sugar with flour, cocoa, and salt; set aside. Using an electric mixer set at medium-high speed, whip egg whites, lemon juice, and vanilla in a medium-sized bowl until peaks form. Set mixer to high speed and whip in remaining 1/2 cup sugar until semistiff peaks form (do not overbeat). With a plastic spatula, slowly fold in the remaining dry ingredients, 1/4 cup at a time, until flour mix disappears. Scoop batter into a 10\" ungreased tube pan and spread evenly. Bake until cake springs back when touched, 45 to 55 minutes. Remove from oven, invert cake pan, and place upside down on a cooling rack. Thoroughly wash and dry berries. Combine berries, nectar, and honey in a small bowl. Mix slowly, being careful not to crush the berries. In a separate bowl, combine yogurt and syrup until blended. Remove cake gently from pan and cut into 8 slices. Serve each slice with fruit and a dollop of maple yogurt."
