            "Peel apricots with a vegetable peeler, then halve and pit. Finely chop 2 halves and set aside.",
            "Heat butter in a 12-inch heavy nonstick skillet over medium heat until foam subsides, then cook sugar, stirring constantly, until golden brown. Stir in Amaretto (be careful; syrup will spatter) and simmer, stirring, 2 minutes.",
