            "2 cups plus 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil, divided",
            "6 packed cups winter greens, such as collards, Lacinato kale or mustard greens, stems removed, leaves cut into 1/4-inch thick ribbons",
            "2 pounds starchy potatoes, such as Yukon gold, peeled and sliced into 1/4-inch rounds (6 to 8 medium potatoes)",
            "1 medium yellow onion, diced",
            "Freshly ground black pepper",
            "10 large eggs",
            "1/2 cup good mayonnaise, such as Hellman's",
            "1 teaspoon piment\u00f3n or smoked Spanish paprika",

        "instructions": [
            "In a 12- to 14-inch non-stick skillet over medium heat, heat 1 tablespoon oil. Add the garlic and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add the greens and cook, tossing occasionally, until wilted and softened, about 5 minutes. Transfer to a large bowl and set aside. Wipe out the skillet and heat 2 cups oil over medium heat until a potato added to the oil sizzles gently. Add half the potatoes and onion to the pan. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the potatoes are soft but not browned, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove potato mixture with a slotted spoon and transfer to the bowl with the greens. Repeat with remaining potato mixture, reserving oil. Season potato mixture with 1 1/2 tablespoons salt and a few grinds of pepper. Add the eggs and stir carefully to combine, keeping the potatoes intact. In the same skillet over medium-high heat, add 1/4 cup reserved oil and swirl to coat. When the pan is hot, add the egg mixture and reduce the heat to low. Give it a shake and gently agitate the eggs in the middle of the pan with a spatula. As the tortilla sets, occasionally shake the pan and run the spatula along the rim to keep the tortilla from sticking. Cook until the eggs are almost set, 25 to 35 minutes. Meanwhile, make the piment\u00f3n aioli. In a small bowl, stir together mayonnaise, piment\u00f3n, Tabsaco, and garlic. Refrigerate until ready to use. When you can easily lift the side of the tortilla up with the spatula and see underneath, it is ready to flip. Place a plate, platter, or inverted or rimless baking sheet larger than the skillet on top of the tortilla in the skillet, then flip the skillet over so the tortilla transfers onto the plate. Slide the tortilla back into the skillet and add any runny egg that was left on the plate. Continue to cook until tortilla is light golden on the underside, pushing the edges under to give it a nice round shape, 5 to 7 minutes more. Flip tortilla onto a wire rack to cool. To serve, thinly slice around the perimeter to square off the sides (save those for a cook's treat). Cut the tortilla in 6 equal rows lengthwise and widthwise to make 36 bites. Serve tortilla with aioli for dipping. DO AHEAD: The tortilla can be made 3 days in advance, kept whole, wrapped tightly in plastic, and refrigerated. The aioli can be made 3 days in advance and refrigerated.",
