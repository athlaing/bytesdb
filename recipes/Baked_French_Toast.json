        "ingredients": [
            "1 (13- to 14-inch-long) loaf of soft-crust supermarket Italian bread",
            "1/2 stick (1/4 cup) unsalted butter, softened",
            "2 large eggs",
            "1 2/3 cups whole milk",
            "3 tablespoons sugar",

        "instructions": [
            "Cut 12 (1-inch-thick) diagonal slices from bread, reserving ends for another use.",
            "Generously butter 1 side of each slice and arrange slices, buttered sides up, in 1 layer in a buttered 13- by 9- by 2-inch glass baking dish, squeezing them slightly to fit if necessary.",
            "Whisk together eggs, milk, and 1/4 teaspoon salt until combined well, then pour evenly over bread. Chill, covered, until bread has absorbed all of custard, at least 1 hour and up to 1 day, depending on bread.",
            "Preheat oven to 425\u00b0F.",
            "Bring mixture to room temperature and sprinkle bread with sugar.",
