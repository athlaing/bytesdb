            "Make crust: Combine flour and salt in processor. Add shortening and butter. Using on/off turns, process until mixture resembles coarse meal. Mix in enough water by tablespoonfuls to form moist clumps. Gather dough into ball; flatten into disk. Wrap in plastic; chill until firm enough to roll out, about 1 hour. Roll out dough on lightly floured surface to generous 1/8-inch-thick round. Transfer round to 9-inch-diameter glass pie dish. Trim edge to 3/4-inch overhang. Fold overhang under and crimp edge decoratively. Refrigerate while making filling.",

            "Make filling: Position rack in bottom third of oven and preheat to 400\u00b0F. Pierce potatoes with toothpick. Cook in microwave on high until tender, about 6 minutes per side. Cut open and cool completely. Scrape potatoes into processor; discard skins. Blend until smooth. Measure enough sweet potato puree to equal 1 1/2 cups. Reserve remaining puree for another use. Place puree in large bowl. Add brown sugar and next 6 ingredients and whisk until smooth. Transfer filling to prepared pie crust. Bake until filling puffs around edges and is set in center, about 50 minutes. Transfer to rack; cool completely. Refrigerate until cold, at least 3 hours. (Can be prepared 1 day ahead. Cover and keep refrigerated.) Serve pie with whipped cream.",
