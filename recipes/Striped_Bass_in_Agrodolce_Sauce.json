        "instructions": [
            "Heat 1/4 cup oil in a 12- to 13-inch heavy skillet over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking, then saut\u00e9 shallots, stirring occasionally, until browned and just tender, about 8 minutes. Remove from heat and add wine, vinegar, water, sugar, raisins, 1 1/4 teaspoons salt, 1/4 teaspoon pepper, and bay leaf, then briskly simmer, stirring occasionally, until shallots are very tender and liquid is thick and syrupy, 40 to 45 minutes. (If liquid is reduced before shallots are tender, add 1/2 cup water and continue to simmer.) Pat fish dry, then sprinkle with remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Fold fillets in half, skinned side in. Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a 12-inch nonstick skillet over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking, then saut\u00e9 4 folded fillets, turning over once, until deep golden, 4 to 6 minutes total. Put cooked fish (still folded) on top of sauce in heavy skillet. Wipe out nonstick skillet and saut\u00e9 remaining 4 fillets in remaining 2 tablespoons oil in same manner, transferring to sauce. Cook, partially covered, over moderate heat until fish is just cooked through, 2 to 3 minutes.",
