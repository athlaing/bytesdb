        "ingredients": [
            "2 tablespoons dark-roast ground coffee (preferably Trung Nguyen Premium Blend or Caf\u00e9 Du Monde Coffee with Chicory)",
            "2 tablespoons (scant) sweetened condensed milk",
            "Ingredient info: Caf\u00e9 Du Monde Coffee with Chicory can be found at cafedumonde.com. The metal filter (phin) and Trung Nguyen coffee can be found at trungnguyen-online.com.",
            "A single-cup Vietnamese metal coffee filter set"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "There are two ways to make Vietnamese coffee. The simplest method is to steep coffee grounds in a heatproof container with 2/3 cup boiling water for 4 minutes. Pour through a coffee filter into a heatproof glass.",
            "Or use a metal filter, which we recommend. Bring 1 cup water to a boil. Remove top screen from filter, add coffee, then screw on top screen. Place filter over a heatproof 12-ounce glass or measuring cup.",
            "Pour a splash of the hot water into filter; this will allow the coffee grounds to bloom. When coffee begins to drip through, add enough water to reach top of filter. Place lid on filter and let coffee drip for 4 minutes. If coffee stops dripping sooner, gently loosen screw to relieve pressure.",
            "Stir in condensed milk until blended. Add ice, stir, and serve."
