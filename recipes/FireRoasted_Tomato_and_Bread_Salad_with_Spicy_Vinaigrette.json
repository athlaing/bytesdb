            "Preheat barbecue (medium-high heat). Brush 2 tablespoons oil over cut sides of tomatoes. Grill tomatoes, cut side down, just until grill marks show but tomatoes are still slightly firm, about 2 minutes. Turn tomatoes over; grill 2 minutes longer. Transfer to baking sheet. Cool slightly. Brush 2 tablespoons oil over both sides of bread slices. Grill until golden, about 2 minutes per side. Transfer to sheet with tomatoes. Cool slightly.",
            "Whisk vinegar, chipotle chili and garlic in medium bowl. Gradually whisk in remaining 4 tablespoons oil. Season vinaigrette with salt and pepper.",
            "Cut grilled tomatoes into 3/4-inch pieces. Cut bread into 1/2-inch pieces. Combine tomatoes, bread and onion in large bowl. Toss to blend. Let stand until bread absorbs most of tomato juices, about 30 minutes. Add vinaigrette and cilantro and toss to blend. Season salad to taste with salt and pepper."
