            "In a large pot of boiling water, cook the s\u014dmen noodles as directed on the package. Drain the noodles and place them in a large bowl filled with ice and water to serve. Your s\u014dmen noodles will be the highlight of the table, so serve them up in a gorgeous bowl. Serve family-style in the middle of your table. Using tongs or chopsticks, place the noodles into individual bowls, shaking off any residual water before serving. Add your choice of sauces and toppings. I usually top with a touch of sh\u014dyu and rice vinegar, and offer a variety of toppings\u2014 negi, katsuobushi, arugula, tofu, avocado slices, etc.",
