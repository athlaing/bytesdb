        "title": "Thai Red Curry with Butternut Squash and Chickpeas ",
        "ingredients": [
            "1 small butternut squash (about 2 pounds)",
            "2 tablespoons canola oil",
            "1/3 cup Thai red curry paste",
            "One 15-ounce can chickpeas (garbanzo beans), drained and rinsed",
            "Kosher salt",
            "One 13-ounce can unsweetened coconut milk",
            "1/3 cup fresh cilantro, plus more for garnish"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "1. Peel the squash, cut it lengthwise in half, and scoop out the seeds. Cut off the top where it meets the bulbous bottom. Cut the bulb end into 3/4- inch-wide wedges. Cut the neck end into 1/2- inch-thick half-moons. 2. Heat a large heavy pot over medium-high heat. Add the canola oil, then add the curry paste and stir for about 1 minute, or until fragrant. Add the squash and stir to coat with the curry paste. Stir in the chickpeas and season with salt. Add the coconut milk and 3/4 cup water and bring to a simmer. Reduce the heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer gently for about 10 minutes, or until the squash just begins to soften. 3. Stir in the cilantro and simmer, uncovered, stirring occasionally, for about 20 minutes, or until the squash is tender but not falling apart and the sauce has reduced slightly. Season to taste with salt. 4. Divide the curry among four soup bowls, top with cilantro, and serve.",
