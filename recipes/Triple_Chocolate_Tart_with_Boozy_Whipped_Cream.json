            "1/2 cup heavy cream",
            "1/2 cup chocolate stout, preferably double chocolate stout (to measure, tilt cup and pour it slowly down side of a liquid measuring cup, then let foam dissipate or skim it off)",
            "2 tablespoons packed light brown sugar",
            "2 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder",
            "2 tablespoons cornstarch",

            "Add butter and pulse to combine, then press evenly onto bottom and up side of tart pan or 1-inch up side of springform pan (a dry measuring cup with a smooth bottom is very useful for pressing crumbs into an even layer).",

            "Make filling: Whisk together milk, cream, stout, sugar, cornstarch, and cocoa in a medium saucepan and bring to a boil over medium heat, whisking constantly, then briskly simmer, whisking constantly, 2 minutes. Remove from heat and whisk in chopped chocolate and vanilla until smooth. Pour chocolate custard into cooled tart shell and cover surface with plastic wrap or wax paper (to prevent a skin from forming) and chill until set, about 3 hours.",
