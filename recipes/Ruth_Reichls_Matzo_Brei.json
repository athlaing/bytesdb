        "ingredients": [
            "4 matzos",
            "4 large eggs",
            "1 teaspoon salt, or to taste",
            "3/4 stick (6 tablespoons) unsalted butter"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Crumble matzos into a large sieve placed over a bowl to catch crumbs, then hold sieve under running cold water until matzos are moist and softened but not completely disintegrated, about 15 seconds. Transfer to bowl with crumbs, then add eggs and salt and mix gently with a fork.",
            "Heat butter in a 10- to 12-inch skillet over moderately high heat until foam subsides. Add matzo mixture and cook, stirring constantly, until eggs are scrambled and matzo has begun to crisp, about 3 minutes."
