            "Najmieh Batmanglij shares her tips with Epicurious: \u2022Though many Iranians now use vegetable oil, clarified butter (ghee) is Iran's traditional cooking fat. To make it, start with a third more unsalted butter than you will need for the recipe. Melt the butter over low heat, then increase the heat to medium low and simmer the butter, without stirring, until it stops crackling and the milk solids brown and drop to the bottom. Skim off any foam from the top, and strain the ghee through a colander lined with cheesecloth. Ghee will keep at room temperature, covered, for several months. \u2022Batmanglij recommends toasting the walnuts in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook, stirring constantly, until they're golden brown \u2014 5 to 10 minutes. \u2022Pom Wonderful brand pomegranate juice, available in many supermarkets, works perfectly in this recipe. \u2022Batmanglij recommends buying saffron in thread form rather than powder, which is often adulterated with turmeric. Before they can be used in a recipe, the threads must be ground with a cube of sugar, using a mortar and pestle or spice grinder, and then diluted in hot water. \"The saffron water can then be stored and used as needed,\" says Batmanglij. \"Never use the unground threads.\" Source Information"
