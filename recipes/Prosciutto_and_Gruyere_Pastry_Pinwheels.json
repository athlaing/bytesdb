        "ingredients": [
            "1 sheet frozen puff pastry (half of 17.3-ounce package), thawed",
            "4 ounces thinly sliced prosciutto",
            "2 tablespoons chopped fresh basil",
            "3/4 cup (packed) finely grated Gruy\u00e8re cheese (about 2 1/2 ounces)",
            "1 egg, beaten to blend"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Place pastry sheet on work surface. Cut in half, forming two 9 1/2x4 3/4-inch rectangles. Arrange half of prosciutto on 1 rectangle, leaving 1/2-inch border along 1 side. Sprinkle prosciutto with half of basil, then top with half of cheese. Brush plain border with egg glaze. Starting at long side opposite border, roll up pastry jelly-roll style, pressing gently to seal long edges. Wrap in plastic. Repeat with remaining pastry, prosciutto, basil, cheese, and egg to form second log. Refrigerate until firm, at least 3 hours and up to 2 days.",
            "Position rack in center of oven and preheat to 400\u00b0F. Line 2 large baking sheets with parchment paper. Cut logs crosswise into 1/2-inch-thick rounds. Arrange rounds on prepared sheets, spacing 1 inch apart. Bake 1 sheet at a time until pastries are golden brown, about 16 minutes. Using metal spatula, transfer pastries to racks and cool slightly. Serve warm."
