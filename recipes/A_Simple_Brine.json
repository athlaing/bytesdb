        "instructions": [
            "Bring salt, sugar, and 4 cups water to a boil in a very large (16-quart) pot, stirring until salt and sugar are dissolved. Turn off heat. Add remaining ingredients to brine base. Refrigerate, uncovered, until cold. Add 6 quarts cold water to pot. Add turkey. Place a plate on top of turkey to keep submerged. Cover; chill for up to 72 hours. (The turkey will be moister and more flavorful if allowed to brine the full 72 hours.)",
