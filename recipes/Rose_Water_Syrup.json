            "Najmieh Batmanglij shares her tips with Epicurious: \u2022Batmanglij recommends buying saffron in thread form rather than powder, which is often adulterated with turmeric. Before they can be used in a recipe, the threads must be ground with a cube of sugar, using a mortar and pestle or spice grinder, and then diluted in hot water. \"The saffron water can then be stored and used as needed,\" says Batmanglij. \"Never use the unground threads.\" \u2022Dried barberries, which add a sour flavor to many Persian dishes, are available online at www.sadaf.com. \"Always buy red barberries,\" cautions Batmanglij. \"Black barberries are old.\" \u2022Try experimenting with different distillates in this drink. Musk rose water, made from white Mediterranean roses, gives the sharbat a different flavor than regular rose water, which is made from Persian Damask roses. Willow water is flowery, while palm water has an earthy flavor.",
