            "Rinse beans and pick over. In a 4-quart heavy saucepan soak beans in water to cover by 2 inches for 1 day.",
            "Bring soaked beans to a boil in water, adding more water if necessary to cover by 1 1/2 inches. Skim any foam from surface of water and gently simmer beans, partially covered, over low heat 1 hour, or until beans are just tender but not falling apart.",
            "In a large heavy skillet cook bacon over moderate heat, turning slices, until golden and crisp. Transfer bacon to paper towels to drain. Add 1 tablespoon bacon fat to beans, reserving bacon and any remaining rendered fat for another use.",
