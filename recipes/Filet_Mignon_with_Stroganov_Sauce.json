Heat oil in a 12-inch heavy skillet over high heat until hot but not smoking. While oil heats, pat steaks dry. Sprinkle 3/4 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper on steaks, then add to skillet and saut\u00e9, turning over once with tongs, about 6 minutes total for medium-rare. Transfer to a plate with tongs. Add onion, garlic, and remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper to oil in skillet and saut\u00e9, scraping up any brown bits with a wooden spoon, until onion begins to brown, about 3 minutes.

Add broth and Worcestershire sauce, then cover and cook until onion is softened, about 4 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in sour cream. Toss noodles with some of sauce and serve remaining sauce over steaks.",
