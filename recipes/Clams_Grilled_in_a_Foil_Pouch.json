            "1. Stack two 2 1/2-foot-long pieces of heavy-duty aluminum foil. In the center, heap 18 littleneck clams, scrubbed; 2 diced seeded plum tomatoes; 1 shallot, thinly sliced; and the leaves from a few sprigs of flat-leaf parsley and oregano sprigs, coarsely chopped. If desired, add a pinch of red pepper flakes. Top with 1 tablespoon unsalted butter (optional). Fold up the sides of the foil to form a pouch.",
            "2. Pour 1/4 cup dry white wine over the clam mixture, and roll the top edges over several times to seal tightly, leaving plenty of room for the clams to steam.",
            "3. Place the pouch on the hot grill and cook for 12 to 15 minutes, until the shells have opened. Serve immediately with grilled crusty bread."
