            "2 12-ounce packages frozen mixed berries",
            "2 tablespoons cornstarch",
            "2/3 cup (packed) golden brown sugar",
            "1/2 cup unbleached all purpose flour",
            "1/2 cup old-fashioned oats",
            "1/2 cup finely chopped walnuts or pecans",
            "1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon",
            "6 tablespoons (3/4 stick) chilled unsalted butter, cut into 1/2-inch cubes",
            "Vanilla ice cream",
            "6 4 1/2-inch-diameter cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e dishes with 1-inch-high sides or other 1-cup ramekins or custard cups"

        "instructions": [
            "Preheat oven to 425\u00b0. Toss frozen berries and cornstarch in large bowl. Let stand until cornstarch dissolves, tossing occasionally, about 20 minutes. Divide berry mixture among six 4 1/2-inch-diameter cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e dishes with 1-inch-high sides. Toss brown sugar, flour, oats, nuts, cinnamon, and 1/4 teaspoon salt in large bowl. Add chilled butter; using fingertips, blend butter into mixture until coarse crumbs form. Divide oat mixture among dishes, sprinkling evenly over berry mixture. Place dishes on rimmed baking sheet. Bake 10 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 350\u00b0F and continue baking until crisp topping is golden brown and fruit filling is bubbling at edges, about 30 minutes longer. Cool crisps at least 15 minutes. Serve warm or at room temperature topped with scoop of vanilla ice cream.",
