            "1. Wash and trim the beet greens. If the stems are very thick, it's worth trimming them back a bit. 2. In a large saut\u00e9 pan over medium heat, saut\u00e9 the garlic, shallot, and red pepper flakes in the olive oil until slightly browned. Add the black pepper, sugar, and salt. 3. Place the beet greens in the pan, pour 1/4 cup water over them, and immediately cover. Once the greens have cooked down, 1 to 2 minutes, remove the lid and stir. Cook for another 1 to 2 minutes, allowing the water to evaporate. 4. Just before serving, pour the vinegar over the greens. Serve and enjoy!",

            "Tips and Techniques If you double the amounts as we did, so that it serves 4 people, add vinegar to taste. Twice the amount may be too much. You could use the same technique with spinach, arugula, chard, or any other dark leafy green.",
