Toss apples, brown sugar, flour, lemon zest, lemon juice, vanilla extract, cinnamon, ginger, and salt in a large bowl. Transfer to a shallow 3-quart baking dish. Drizzle all but 2 Tbsp. brown butter over apples. Top with pieces of puff pastry, then brush pastry with remaining brown butter. Sprinkle with granulated sugar.

Reduce temperature to 350\u00b0F and bake until juices are thick and bubbling and pastry is brown all over, 30\u201335 minutes longer. Using a spoon, press pastry down into warm juices (but don\u2019t submerge); let cool slightly. Serve warm with ice cream.",
