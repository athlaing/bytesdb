        "title": "Scalloped Potatoes With Coconut Milk and Chilies ",
        "ingredients": [
            "1 can (13.5 ounces) unsweetened coconut milk",
            "2 tablespoons Balchao Masala",
            "1 1/2 teaspoons coarse kosher or sea salt",
            "Vegetable cooking spray",
            "1 pound russet or Yukon Gold potatoes, peeled, cut crosswise or lengthwise (depending on their size) into 1/4-inch-thick slices, and submerged in a bowl of cold water to prevent browning",
            "4 scallions (green tops and white bulbs), thinly sliced crosswise",
            "8 to 10 medium-size to large fresh curry leaves"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Preheat the oven to 350\u00b0F.",
            "Whisk the coconut milk, masala, and salt together in a small bowl.",
            "Lightly spray a casserole dish with cooking spray. Drain the potatoes. Cover the bottom of the casserole with a layer of potatoes, and sprinkle a third of the scallions over them. Stir the sauce (the masala tends to sink to the bottom, so a good stir helps to mix everything evenly) and drizzle a third of it over the layer. Repeat the layers of potatoes, scallions, and masala two more times, using up all the ingredients",
            "Spread the curry leaves over the top layer. Cover the dish and bake until the potatoes are fork-tender, about 45 minutes.",
            "Remove the cover and continue to bake until the potatoes are browned, 10 to 15 minutes. Then serve."
