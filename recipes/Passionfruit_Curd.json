        "ingredients": [
            "10 passionfruit, halved and flesh scooped out of the skins",
            "100g (1/2 cup/1 stick) unsalted butter",
            "150g (about 2/3 cup) superfine sugar",
            "2 eggs plus 2 yolks",
            "2 sterilized jars and lids to store the curd."
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Sterilize the jars and lids you are using: wash them thoroughly with hot soapy water, rinse then dry them completely in an oven preheated to 110\u00b0C/90 \u00b0C fan/gas 1/4/225\u00b0F.",
            "Briefly whizz fruit in a food processor to loosen the seeds from the juice. Strain the liquid through a sieve into a jug \u2013 this will be your fruit juice. If you want a curd with seeds in it (passionfruit seeds are particularly nice), stir a few tablespoons of the leftover pulp into the curd before you pour it into the jars.",
            "In a medium saucepan, combine the juice with all the other ingredients. Heat on low, whisking all the time, until the butter has completely melted.",
            "Turn the heat up to medium and continue to whisk. After 5\u20136 minutes, the mixture will thicken enough to coat the back of a spoon. Remove from the heat, pour into the sterilized jars and screw on the lids. The curd will keep in the fridge for up to two weeks."
