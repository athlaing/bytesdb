        "instructions": [
            "Preheat oven to 275\u00b0F. Line 2 rimmed baking sheets with parchment paper. Whisk cornstarch and sea salt in a small bowl, breaking up any lumps. Mix ginger, allspice, nutmeg, cloves, and 1 Tbsp. cinnamon in another small bowl.",
            "Using an electric mixer on medium-high speed, beat egg whites and cream of tartar in a large bowl until soft, opaque peaks form, about 3 minutes. You should see tracks from the whisk on the surface of the whites.",
            "Add superfine sugar slowly, 1 Tbsp. at a time, beating to incorporate fully before adding the next, 5\u20138 minutes total. Continue to beat on medium-high speed until stiff, glossy peaks form, about 1 minute more. Test to see if sugar is fully dissolved by rubbing a small amount between your fingertips. If it feels gritty, keep beating until dissolved.",
            "Sprinkle cornstarch mixture over egg whites and fold in gently with a spatula. Sift spices over mixture with a fine-mesh strainer and fold in gently.",
            "Using a large spoon, divide meringue into 8 even mounds on prepared baking sheets. Using the back of the spoon, make a small well in the center of each meringue. Using fine-mesh strainer, lightly dust with remaining 1 tsp. cinnamon.",
            "Bake 15 minutes, then reduce oven temperature to 250\u00b0F. Continue to bake, rotating sheets halfway through, until outsides are dry and a very pale cream color, 50\u201360 minutes. Turn oven off and leave door slightly ajar (prop open with a kitchen towel or hot pad) with meringues inside, letting them cool completely, at least 2 hours or up to overnight.",
            "For the pumpkin mousse: Gently whisk egg whites and granulated sugar in a medium bowl set over a saucepan of barely simmering water until hot to the touch or a candy thermometer registers 140\u00b0F. Pour hot egg white mixture into stand mixer bowl and whip with the whisk attachment on medium-high speed until doubled in volume and stiff peaks form, about 5 minutes. Whisk pumpkin pur\u00e9e, kosher salt, and vanilla in a medium bowl. Whisk one-third of beaten egg whites into pumpkin mixture to lighten. Gently whisk in remaining whites.",
