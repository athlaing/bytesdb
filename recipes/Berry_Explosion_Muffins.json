            "In a cup, mix ground chia seeds with 1/2 cup water and let sit until it forms a gel, about 5 minutes. In a high-powered blender, combine white beans, pitted dates, banana, half of the thawed strawberries (leaving the other half to be put in the muffins whole), chia seed gel, and vanilla and almond extracts. Once blended, combine with the dry mixture and stir thoroughly until well combined.",

            "To make cookies, drop batter by spoonfuls onto a foil-lined cookie sheet and bake for 10 minutes or until lightly browned."
