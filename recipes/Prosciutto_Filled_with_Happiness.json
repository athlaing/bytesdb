        "ingredients": [
            "1/4 cup pine nuts",
            "About 20 thin slices of good-quality prosciutto",
            "1 small bunch arugula",
            "1/4 pound gorgonzola",
            "1/4 cup currants"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Spread the pine nuts on a baking sheet and bake at 350\u00b0F until they turn golden brown. (I do mine in the toaster oven.) You'll want to keep a close eye on these because they go from golden brown to burned very quickly, as I've learned on three or four occasions. Transfer them to a small bowl and let them cool. Cut each slice of prosciutto in half, crosswise. Don't worry if they're not perfect. Top each half-slice with a small piece of arugula, a dab of gorgonzola, a few pine nuts, and few currents. Then roll them into little mini horns. Arrange on a platter and serve.",
