            "1/2 cup unblanched almonds plus sliced almonds for garnish",
            "1 cantaloupe, halved, the seeds discarded and the flesh scooped out",
            "2 tablespoons honey",

            "In a shallow baking pan toast the unblanched almonds in the middle of a preheated 350\u00b0F. oven for 5 to 8 minutes, or until they are aromatic, and transfer them to a blender. Add 1 1/2 cups water and blend the mixture until the almonds are ground fine. Strain the mixture through a fine sieve set over a bowl, pressing hard on the solids, discard the solids, and return the almond milk to the blender, cleaned. Add the cantaloupe, the honey, the lime juice, and a pinch of salt and blend the mixture until it is smooth. Transfer the soup to a bowl and chill it for 1 hour, or until it is cold. Divide the soup among chilled bowls, and garnish it with the sliced almonds and the lime slices.",
