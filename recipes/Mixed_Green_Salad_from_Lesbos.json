            "3-4 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil",
            "2-3 tablespoons red wine vinegar",
            "Freshly ground black pepper",
            "1 small head romaine lettuce, cored and leaves separated",
            "1 bunch arugula, trimmed and finely chopped",
            "3-4 sprigs watercress, finely chopped",
            "3 scallions (white and most of the green parts), thinly sliced",
            "4 sprigs fresh dill, finely chopped",
            "3-4 sprigs fresh mint, tough stems removed, thinly sliced",
            "3-4 sprigs borage, coarsely chopped (optional; see Note)",
            "1 small fennel bulb, trimmed and very finely chopped or grated",
            "Salt",
            "1/4 cup toasted pine nuts (optional)"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "In a small bowl, whisk together the oil, vinegar and plenty of pepper. Set aside.",
            "Stack half the lettuce leaves, roll them up and cut crosswise into thin slices. Repeat with the remaining lettuce leaves.",
            "In a large bowl, combine the lettuce and other greens, scallions, dill, mint, borage (if using) and fennel. Whisk the dressing again and pour it over the salad. Add salt to taste, toss, and sprinkle with the pine nuts, if using. Serve at once.",
            "NOTE: There is no substitute for borage \u2014 its sweet taste and crunchy texture are unique \u2014 but I have heard it compared to very tender cucumbers. If you like, add 1/2 cup coarsely grated cucumber to the salad."
