            "Cover beans with cold water to cover by 2 inches in a large bowl and soak, covered, overnight. Drain in a colander.",
            "Cook onion and carrot in butter in a 4- to 5-quart pot over moderate heat, stirring occasionally, until onion is softened, about 5 minutes. Add soaked beans, lemon juice, garlic, thyme, and bay leaf and cover with cold water by 1 inch. Simmer beans, partially covered, until tender, 50 minutes to 1 hour. Add salt, then cool beans in their cooking liquid, uncovered, until warm.",
            "Prepare artichokes while beans are simmering: Squeeze juice from 1 lemon half into a large bowl of cold water, then drop same half into water. Cut off stem of 1 artichoke flush with base using a sharp paring knife. Bend back outer leaves until they snap off close to base, then discard several more layers of leaves in same manner until you reach pale yellow leaves with pale green tips. Cut yellow leaves flush with top of artichoke bottom. Discard purple leaves and scoop out fuzzy choke with melon-ball cutter. Trim dark green fibrous parts from base and sides of artichoke with knife, then rub artichoke bottom all over with another lemon half and drop artichoke into acidulated water. Trim remaining artichokes in same manner. Put 3 quarts water in a 5-quart pot, then squeeze juice from remaining 2 lemon halves into water and stir in oil and salt. Bring to a simmer. Drain artichoke bottoms and add to simmering liquid, then simmer, partially covered, until tender, about 25 minutes. Cool artichokes in cooking liquid until warm.",
