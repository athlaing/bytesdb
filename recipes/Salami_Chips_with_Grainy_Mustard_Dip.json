        "ingredients": [
            "1/4 cup sour cream",
            "1/4 cup top-quality mayonnaise",

        ],
        "instructions": [
            "To make the dip, stir together the sour cream, mayonnaise, Dijon mustard, and grainy mustard in a small serving bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until you are ready to serve, ideally at least 2 hours.",
            "Preheat the oven to 375\u00b0F. Line 2 rimmed baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats. Set 2 oven racks at the centermost positions.",
            "Lay the salami slices out in a single layer on the baking sheets. Bake until they are evenly browned and rigid, 10 to 12 minutes. Transfer to paper towels to drain and cool. The salami will crisp further as it cools.",
