            "1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter",
            "3/4 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg",
            "3/4 teaspoon freshly ground white pepper",
            "3/4 pound Gruy\u00e8re, coarsely grated (about 4 cups)",
            "1/2 pound fresh mozzarella, coarsely grated (about 1 1/2 cups)",

        "instructions": [
            "Place rack in middle of oven and preheat to 350\u00b0F. Place potatoes in a large wide heavy pot. Add 1 1/2 tsp. salt and enough cold water to cover by 2\". Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until potatoes break apart when pierced with the tip of a knife, 35\u201340 minutes.",
            "Meanwhile, cook garlic, cream, and butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat, whisking occasionally, until butter is melted. Whisk in nutmeg, pepper, and 1 Tbsp. plus 1 tsp. salt. Remove from heat.",
            "Drain potatoes and immediately pass through potato ricer into a large bowl. Stir in cream mixture until smooth.",
            "Return half of potato mixture to wide pot; reserve remaining potato mixture in bowl. Add Gruy\u00e8re and mozzarella and cook over low heat, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon, until cheese is melted and mixture can be stretched with the spoon (like warm mozzarella), about 10 minutes. Transfer to gratin dish; smooth top.",
            "Working in batches if needed, spoon reserved potato mixture in bowl into pastry bag fitted with star tip. Pipe very tight rows of 1/2x1/2\" rosettes on potato-cheese mixture in gratin dish. Bake until top is golden brown, about 45 minutes. Let stand 10 minutes before serving."
