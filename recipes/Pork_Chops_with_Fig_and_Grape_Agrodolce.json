Transfer chops to a wire rack set inside a rimmed baking sheet; reserve pan drippings in skillet. Roast pork until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center registers 135\u00b0F, about 15 minutes. Let pork rest 5 minutes.",

Stir in red pepper flakes, if using, 2 Tbsp. honey, and 1/4 tsp. salt. Add grapes, figs, and rosemary and stir to coat. Continue to cook, stirring occasionally, until sauce is thickened and fruit is softened, about 8 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in butter.",
