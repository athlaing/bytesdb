        "ingredients": [
            "1-1/2 tablespoons unsalted butter",
            "1-3/4 pounds carrots, peeled and cut into thin rounds",
            "10 ounces pearl onions, peeled and very thinly sliced",
            "3 shallots, peeled, cut in half lengthwise, then into thin half-moon slices",
            "sea salt",
            "1 cup water",
            "freshly ground black pepper",
            "4 pounds fresh peas in their pods, to give 4 cups shelled peas (you may used unthawed, frozen peas, adjusting the cooking time slightly)",
            "1 head of butter lettuce, leaves separated, heart left intact, and rinsed"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Melt the butter in a large, heavy saucepan over medium heat. Add the carrots, onions, and shallots, stirring so they are coated with the butter. Season lightly with salt. Cover and cook, stirring occasionally, until the carrots are softened but still have plenty of texture, about 8 minutes. Stir in the water, season with salt and pepper, and continue cooking, covered, until the carrots are nearly tender, an additional 8 minutes. Add the peas and stir. Then lay the lettuce heart and leaves over the vegetables. Cover, and cook until the lettuce leaves are wilted and the peas are done to your liking (I like them bright green and cooked through to a juicy tenderness), 10 to 15 minutes.",
