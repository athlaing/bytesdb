        "ingredients": [
            "1 teaspoon kosher salt",
            "3 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for surface",
            "6 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted, plus more, room temperature, for brushing (about 10 tablespoons)",
            "Olive oil (for parchment)",
            "Flaky sea salt (such as Maldon)"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Whisk kosher salt and 3 cups flour in a large bowl. Drizzle in melted butter; mix well. Gradually mix in 3/4 cup water. Knead on a lightly floured surface until dough is shiny and very soft, about 5 minutes. Wrap in plastic; let rest in a warm spot at least 4 hours.",
            "Divide dough into 10 pieces and, using your palm, roll into balls. Place balls on a baking sheet, cover with plastic wrap, and let rest 15 minutes.",
            "Roll dough into thin rounds, brush with room-temperature butter, and roll up into ropes (see step-by-step instructions, below). Working with 1 coil at a time, roll out on an unfloured surface to 10\" rounds no more than 1/8\" thick. Stack as you go, separating with sheets of parchment brushed with oil.",
            "Heat a large cast-iron griddle or skillet over medium-high heat. Working 1 at a time, brush both sides of a dough round with room-temperature butter and cook until lightly blistered and cooked through, about 2 minutes per side. Transfer bread to a wire rack and sprinkle with sea salt.",
            "DO AHEAD: Coils can be rolled out 1 month ahead; wrap tightly and freeze. Cook from frozen (add 1\u20132 minutes to cooking time)."
