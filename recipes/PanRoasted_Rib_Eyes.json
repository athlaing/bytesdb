            "Kosher salt and coarsely ground black pepper",

        "instructions": [
            "Preheat oven to 400\u00b0F. Season steaks generously with salt and pepper; let rest at room temperature for 30 minutes. Scatter thyme and rosemary sprigs evenly in bottom of a roasting pan; dot with 4 tablespoons butter.",
            "Melt 1 tablespoon butter with 1 tablespoon oil in a large heavy skillet over medium-high heat. Reduce heat to medium and add 1 steak to skillet. Cook until seared and golden brown on all sides (including edges), 2-3 minutes per side. Transfer steak to prepared roasting pan. Pour out oil and wipe skillet with paper towels. Repeat with remaining 1 tablespoon butter, 1 tablespoon oil, and steak.",
            "Roast steaks in oven, turning halfway through cooking and basting frequently with herb butter in pan, until an instant-read thermometer inserted into steak registers 125\u00b0F for medium-rare, about 20 minutes, or to desired doneness.",
            "Transfer steaks to a cutting board. Drizzle 1 tablespoon herb butter from roasting pan over each steak and let rest for 10 minutes. Slice against the grain and divide among plates. Don't forget to set out the bones for those who like to gnaw on them. Serve with B\u00e9arnaise Sauce."
