            "1 French-bread baguette",
            "1/4 cup (1/2 stick) butter",
            "1/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil",

        "instructions": [
            "Preheat oven to 350\u00b0F. Slice baguette on sharp diagonal to make about twenty 6- to 7-inch-long, 1/4-inch-thick slices. Melt butter with oil and garlic in small saucepan over medium heat. Remove from heat. Brush butter mixture over both sides of bread slices. Arrange bread in single layer on 2 baking sheets. Sprinkle cheese over bread. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Bake until bread is crisp, about 13 minutes. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Store airtight at room temperature. Rewarm in 350\u00b0F oven 3 minutes.)"
