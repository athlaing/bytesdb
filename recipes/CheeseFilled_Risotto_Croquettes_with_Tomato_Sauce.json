        "ingredients": [
            "3 cups leftover cooked risotto",
            "1/2 cup grated Parmesan",
            "2 Tbsp heavy cream",
            "2 Tbsp minced fresh flat-leaf parsley, chives, oregano, or basil",
            "1 large egg yolk",
            "Salt and freshly ground pepper",
            "5 oz mozzarella or Fontina cheese",
            "All-purpose flour for dredging",
            "Egg wash: 1 large egg whisked with 2 Tbsp cold milk or water",
            "1 cup fresh white bread crumbs",
            "Vegetable oil for deep-frying",
            "2 cups tomato sauce"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "In a large bowl, combine the risotto with the Parmesan, cream, herbs, and egg yolk. Season with salt and pepper.",
            "Cut the cheese into 16 cubes. Scoop up about 3 Tbsp of the risotto mixture and pack it around a cube of cheese to make a croquette, a ball the size of a Ping-Pong ball. Repeat to form 16 croquettes.",
            "Put the flour, egg wash, and bread crumbs in 3 separate bowls. Dredge the croquettes in the flour, dip in the egg wash, and roll in the bread crumbs. Chill thoroughly, 2-24 hours.",
            "Pour oil into a tall pot to a depth of 5 inches. Heat the oil over medium-high heat until it registers 375\u00b0F on a deep-frying thermometer. Deep-fry the croquettes in batches, without crowding, until they are evenly browned, 4-5 minutes. Using a slotted spoon or tongs, transfer to paper towels to drain briefly. Serve on a pool of warmed tomato sauce."
