            "1/8 teaspoon ground hot red pepper (cayenne)",
            "1/8 teaspoon black pepper",
            "3/4 cup firmly packed chunky or creamy peanut butter",
            "5 cups rich chicken stock or broth",
            "1/2 cup coarsely chopped pecans",
            "1/2 cup heavy cream",
            "1/2 teaspoon salt, or to taste",

        ],
        "instructions": [
            "1. Melt the butter in a large, heavy saucepan over moderate heat. Add the celery and onion and saut\u00e9 for 8 to 10 minutes or until limp and golden. Blend in the curry powder, cumin, coriander, turmeric, cayenne, and black pepper, then cook and stir 1 minute more.",
            "2. Add the peanut butter, then gradually mix in the chicken stock. Bring to a boil, adjust the heat so the soup bubbles gently, and simmer uncovered, stirring now and then, for 20 minutes or until the flavors \"marry.\" Add the pecans and cook, stirring occasionally, for 2 minutes more. Remove the soup from the heat and cool for 10 minutes.",
            "3. Pur\u00e9e the soup by churning in batches in the food processor or in an electric blender at high speed. It will still be lumpy. Note: For a silky soup, force through a fine sieve.",
            "4. Return the soup to the pan, add the cream and salt, set over moderate heat, and bring to a simmer. Taste for salt and adjust as needed. Or, if you prefer, refrigerate the soup for up to two days. When ready to serve, reheat the soup or serve cold.",
            "5. Ladle into heated (or chilled) soup plates, and sprinkle each portion with paprika, peanuts, and chives. Then, if you like, top with the mango chutney."
