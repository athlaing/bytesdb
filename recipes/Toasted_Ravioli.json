            "2 large eggs",
            "1/2 cup canned evaporated milk",
            "1 cup Italian-style bread crumbs",
            "1 1/2 cups good-quality marinara sauce",
            "about 4 cups vegetable oil for frying",

        "instructions": [
            "In a shallow bowl beat together eggs and evaporated milk. Put bread crumbs in another shallow bowl. In a small saucepan heat sauce over moderate heat until hot and keep warm, covered. In a small heavy kettle (about 5 quarts) heat 1 inch oil over moderate heat until a deep-fat thermometer registers 350\u00b0F. While oil is heating, dip ravioli in egg to coat, letting excess drip off, and dredge in bread crumbs, knocking off excess. Arrange ravioli as coated on a tray. With a slotted spoon gently lower 4 ravioli into oil and fry, turning them occasionally, until golden brown and cooked through, 2 to 3 minutes. With slotted spoon transfer ravioli as fried to paper towels to drain. Return oil to 350\u00b0F. before frying remaining ravioli in same manner. Transfer hot ravioli to a platter and sprinkle with Parmesan. Serve ravioli with warm marinara sauce for dipping.",
