            "Crust: Whisk salt and 1 1/2 cups flour in a medium bowl. Using a fork, work in shortening until mixture is crumbly. Mix in 2 tablespoons cold water and knead until dough just comes together. Roll out dough on a lightly floured surface until about 1/4\" thick. Fold in half, then in half again (so that it's folded into quarters); roll out to a 12\" round. Transfer to a 9\" pie dish. Lift up edges and let dough slump down into dish. Trim, leaving about 1\" overhang. Fold edges under and crimp. Freeze while you make the filling.",
