            "1 pound sugar snap peas, trimmed and strings removed (see note)",
            "A five-finger pinch of mint leaves (preferably black mint), roughly chopped at the last minute",
            "1/4 cup Simple Lemon Dressing",
            "Maldon or another flaky sea salt",
            "Lemon juice",
            "Large handful delicate, peppery arugula"

        "instructions": [
            "So long as you find the right snap peas, you'll have a smashing salad. But I find that putting your knife to them adds even more excitement, a little textural variation and attractiveness. Accordingly, run the tip of your knife along the spine of some of the larger pods, open them like a book to expose the peas, and gently pull to separate the two sides of the pod. Slice others diagonally in half or thirds. Keep small ones whole.",
            "Combine the peas and mint in a large bowl. Pour in the dressing and toss gently but well. Season to taste with more salt and lemon, if you'd like. Add the arugula to the bowl and toss gently to coat the leaves in the dressing without bruising them. Arrange it all prettily on a platter and serve straightaway."
