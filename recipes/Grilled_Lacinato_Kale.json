        "title": "Grilled Lacinato Kale ",
        "ingredients": [
            "2 bunches lacinato kale (also known as black, dinosaur, or Tuscan kale)",
            "2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil",
            "Kosher salt"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Strip away and discard the stems of the kale. Tear the leaves into large bite-size pieces and toss them with the olive oil and a good pinch of salt.",
            "Cook the leaves briefly over a medium fire seasoned with chunks of maple or oak. They will begin to burn and sizzle almost immediately. This is a good thing. Resist the temptation to turn them; the burn is good; the burn is your friend. After 4 to 5 minutes, turn them once to give a slight char to the wilted leaves that have been on top. Cook for another minute or two, and then remove them from the grill. That's it. Serve immediately."
