            "1 tablespoon nonfat dry milk powder",
            "1/8 teaspoons kosher salt",
            "1/3 cup small pearl tapioca (not instant or quick-cooking)",

            "Whisk milk, cream, milk powder, and salt in a medium saucepan; add tapioca and let sit 30 minutes to hydrate. Add sugar to tapioca mixture and bring to a simmer over medium heat. Reduce heat to medium-low and cook, stirring often, until the consistency of a thick soup, 10-12 minutes. Whisk in egg yolk and cook, stirring occasionally, 2 minutes (it will thicken slightly). Let cool, stirring occasionally, 10 minutes. Divide among small glasses. Chill pudding until cold (it will thicken), at least 2 hours. Serve topped with nutmeg. Do ahead: Pudding can be made 3 days ahead. Cover and keep chilled.",
