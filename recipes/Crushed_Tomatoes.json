        "instructions": [
            "Start with the best canned plum or pear tomatoes you can find. I recommend Valoroso or DiNapoli brands. Whether you start with canned or cooked fresh tomatoes, you'll want to rinse your hands frequently as you work, so set up your station near the sink or have a bowl of cold water nearby.",
            "Put a strainer over a bowl. Working over a second bowl, lift a tomato, pinch off the head (stem end) and any unripe areas, and let those pieces drop into the bowl. Some tomatoes may not be deep red. I prefer not to use those, but it's your call. Open up the tomato, remove any skins, seeds, or tough sections and add them to your discard bowl. Break the cleaned tomato into small pieces or strips and put them in the strainer. Keep in mind that these will not be blended, so if they look too coarse for your taste, run them through your fingers to make smaller pieces.",
            "Continue cleaning and crushing tomatoes until you have the amount called for in your recipe. Press gently on the tomatoes to strain as much liquid as possible. Discard the contents of the discard bowl and the bowl below the strainer. One 28-ounce can of tomatoes should yield 1 generous cup (250 grams) crushed tomatoes. The glaze can be stored in a covered container at room temperature for several months."
