        "ingredients": [
            "2/3 cup skin-on hazelnuts (about 3 1/2 ounces)",
            "1 large egg white",
            "Pinch of kosher salt",
            "1/3 cup sugar"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Preheat oven to 350\u00b0F. Toast hazelnuts on a rimmed baking sheet, tossing occasionally, until golden brown, 13\u201315 minutes. Wrap nuts in a kitchen towel and let steam 1 minute. Rub nuts in towel to remove loose skins (don't worry about skins that don't come off) and let cool completely. Pulse in a food processor until coarsely chopped.",
            "Reduce oven temperature to 300\u00b0F. Using an electric mixer on medium-high speed (or using a whisk), beat egg white and salt in a medium bowl until stiff peaks form. Gently fold in sugar and chopped hazelnuts until well combined.",
            "Using a tablespoon, spoon batter onto a parchment-lined rimmed baking sheet, spacing about 2\" apart. Bake cookies until golden brown, 16\u201318 minutes. Transfer cookies to wire racks and let cool."
