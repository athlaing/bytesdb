        "title": "Passion Fruit Jell-O Whip ",
        "ingredients": [
            "2 cups [480 ml] passion fruit juice",
            "3 Tbsp granulated sugar",
            "1 standard packet [about 2 1/2 tsp] powdered gelatin",
            "1/2 cup [120 ml] heavy cream",
            "Mixed berries and mint sprigs for garnish"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Chill one cup [240 ml] of the juice and pour it into the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment and set aside. Pour the other cup [240 ml] into a small saucepan, add the sugar, stir, and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Sprinkle the gelatin over the cold juice in the mixer bowl and let sit for 1 minute. Pour the hot juice over the cold, and stir to combine. Place in the refrigerator until thickened and beginning to gel, about an hour and a half. The lightly set juice should still be wobbly, and when you tip the bowl slightly, it should cling to the side, rather than running up it like a liquid.",
            "Remove the bowl from the refrigerator and using a rubber spatula, scrape up any bits of gelled juice from the bottom of the bowl. Attach the bowl to the stand mixer, and at medium-high speed, whisk until foamy and tripled in size, at least five to six minutes. You want to make sure you break up and liquefy all of the gelled juice.",
            "Meanwhile, place the cream in a medium-sized bowl, and with an electric hand-mixer, beat the cream at medium to medium-high speed until the cream holds medium peaks, about 2 - 3 minutes. Fold the whipped cream into the gelatin mixture until fully incorporated and transfer to 5 small serving vessels. Refrigerate for 1 to 2 hours, until set.",
            "Serve with mixed berries or a sprig or two of mint.",
            "Do Ahead Passion Fruit Whip will keep tightly wrapped in plastic wrap in the refrigerator for up to 3 days.",
