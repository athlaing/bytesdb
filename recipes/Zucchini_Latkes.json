            "1 1/3 cups plain fine dry bread crumbs",
            "2 large eggs, lightly beaten",
            "1/2 teaspoon dried marjoram",
            "About 1 cup vegetable oil for frying",

            "Grate zucchini using medium shredding disk of a food processor. Transfer to a bowl and toss with 2 teaspoons salt. Let stand 30 minutes.",
            "Squeeze zucchini in batches in a kitchen towel to remove as much liquid as possible. Transfer zucchini to a large bowl and stir in bread crumbs, eggs, marjoram, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper.",
            "Preheat oven to 200\u00b0F.",
            "Heat 1/3 cup oil in a 12-inch heavy skillet over medium heat until it shimmers. Scoop 2 tablespoon mixture per latke into skillet (6 to 8 per batch). Flatten with a fork to form 2 1/2-to 3-inch pancakes. Fry until golden brown, about 2 minutes per side (adding more oil as necessary). Transfer to a paper-towel-lined baking sheet and keep warm in oven."
