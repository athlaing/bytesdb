        "title": "Gingery Ground Chicken ",
        "ingredients": [
            "12 ounces ground chicken, preferably a combination of dark and light meat",
            "2 tablespoons sak\u00e9",
            "2 teaspoons sugar",
            "2 tablespoons soy sauce",
            "1 teaspoon ginger juice"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Place the chicken in a skillet. Add the sak\u00e9 and sugar and stir to separate the bits of meat before starting to cook. Place the pan over low heat and cook, continuing to break up the meat into crumblike clusters. At first the liquid will look cloudy, but within a few minutes it will become clear and the meat will turn white.",
            "Skim the liquid to remove excess fat and then add the soy sauce. Continue to simmer for another 2 to 3 minutes and then add the ginger juice. Turn up the heat to reduce the excess liquid in the pan. Ideally, about 1 teaspoon will remain. Remove from the heat, let cool to room temperature, cover, and refrigerate for up to 3 days or freeze for up to 1 month. Reheat over low heat, adding a few drops of water, if necessary, and stirring to break up clusters."
