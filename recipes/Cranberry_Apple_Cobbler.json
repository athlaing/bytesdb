        "title": "Cranberry Apple Cobbler ",
        "ingredients": [
            "1 1/2 cups cranberries, picked over",
            "1 Granny Smith apple, peeled and sliced thin",
            "1 tablespoon freshly grated orange zest",
            "1/2 cup firmly packed light brown sugar",
            "1/4 teaspoon cinnamon",
            "a pinch of ground cloves",
            "1/2 cup plus 1 tablespoon all-purpose flour",
            "1 tablespoon unsalted butter, cut into bits",
            "1/2 teaspoon double-acting baking powder",
            "1/4 teaspoon salt",
            "2 tablespoons vegetable shortening",
            "1/3 cup plain yogurt",
            "1/2 teaspoon granulated sugar",
            "vanilla ice cream as an accompaniment if desired"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "In a shallow 2-cup baking dish toss together the cranberries, the apple, the zest, the brown sugar, the cinnamon, the cloves, and 1 tablespoon of the flour and dot the top with the butter. In a bowl stir together the remaining 1/2 cup flour, the baking powder, and the salt. Add the shortening, blend the mixture until it resembles coarse meal, and stir in the yogurt. (The dough will be sticky.) Drop the dough by spoonfuls onto the cranberry mixture, sprinkle it with the granulated sugar, and bake the cobbler in the middle of a preheated 400\u00b0F. oven for 30 minutes, or until the top is golden. Serve the cobbler with the ice cream."
