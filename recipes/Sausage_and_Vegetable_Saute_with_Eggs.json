            "Heat oil in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat. Add sausages, potatoes, onions, bell peppers and chili and saut\u00e9 until vegetables begin to soften, about 10 minutes. Add tomatoes and 1/2 cup water and bring to boil. Reduce heat to medium, cover skillet and simmer until vegetables are tender and sausage is cooked through, about 15 minutes. Uncover skillet; simmer until sauce is thick, about 8 minutes. One at a time, crack eggshells and drop eggs onto sausage mixture, spacing evenly. Cover and cook until egg whites are set and yolks still feel soft to touch, about 4 minutes. Serve immediately."
