            "1 bone-in Boston butt or boneless pork shoulder roast, 5 to 7 pounds",
            "Olive oil",
            "Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste",
            "freshly ground black pepper",
            "Hickory wood chips or chunks",
            "8 to 10 white hamburger buns",
            "Lexington-Style Barbecue Sauce",

        "instructions": [
            "Grilling Method: Indirect/Medium Heat Soak hickory or other flavor wood chips in water for 30 minutes. Place chips directly on gray-ashed charcoal if using a charcoal grill or in the smoker box if using a gas grill. Lightly oil the pork and season with salt and pepper. Place meat in the center of the cooking grate and cook slowly over low heat for 4 to 5 hours or until an instant-read meat thermometer registers 180\u00b0F-190\u00b0F. The meat should be very tender and falling apart. You'll know it's done when the bone pulls out clean as a whistle and the meat has shrunk in size. Let the meat rest for about 15 minutes. While it is still hot, pull meat from skin and fat. Discard all but the best meat. Shred or pull the meat apart with two forks. As you work, mix pork with enough sauce to moisten. Serve on white hamburger buns and top with North Carolina Coleslaw that has been dressed with the same sauce. Serve additional sauce on the side, if desired.",
