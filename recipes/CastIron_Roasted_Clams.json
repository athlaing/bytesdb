            "3 pounds medium (3- to 4-inch) red potatoes",
            "16 garlic cloves, peeled",

            "1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil",
            "1 teaspoon salt",
            "1/2 teaspoon black pepper",
            "1 3/4 pound plum tomatoes (10 to 12), halved lengthwise",
            "40 small hard-shelled clams (4 lb) such as littlenecks (less than 2 inches wide), scrubbed well",
            "1/2 teaspoon dried hot red pepper flakes",
            "1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley",

        "instructions": [
            "Preheat oven to 500\u00b0F.",
            "Cut potatoes into 1/2-inch-thick slices and toss with garlic, onions, oil, salt, and pepper in skillet (or roasting pan). Roast in middle of oven until potatoes begin to brown, about 15 minutes. Add tomatoes, tossing to combine, and roast until skins wrinkle and split, about 10 minutes.

Sprinkle with parsley and serve in skillet."
