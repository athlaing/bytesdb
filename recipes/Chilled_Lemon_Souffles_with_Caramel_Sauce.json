            "Vegetable oil",
            "1/4 cup water",
            "1 teaspoon unflavored gelatin",
            "3 large eggs, separated",
            "2 tablespoons cornstarch",
            "1 cup plus 2 tablespoons whole milk",
            "6 tablespoons sugar, divided",

            "1 1/2 teaspoons finely grated lemon peel",

        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Lightly oil six 3/4-cup souffl\u00e9 dishes or custard cups; set aside. Pour 1/4 cup water into small bowl. Sprinkle gelatin over; let stand until gelatin softens, about 15 minutes.",
            "Meanwhile, whisk egg yolks and cornstarch in medium bowl until smooth. Combine milk and 3 tablespoons sugar in heavy medium saucepan; stir over medium heat until sugar dissolves and mixture comes to simmer. Gradually whisk 1/3 of hot milk mixture into yolk mixture. Pour mixture back into remaining milk mixture in saucepan. Whisk constantly over medium-high heat until mixture boils and thickens, about 2 minutes. Reduce heat to medium and whisk 2 minutes longer. Remove from heat; whisk in lemon juice and lemon peel. Add gelatin mixture; stir until gelatin dissolves.",
            "Whisk egg whites and remaining 3 tablespoons sugar in medium bowl to blend. Set bowl over saucepan of simmering water (do not allow bottom of bowl to touch water); whisk constantly until instant-read thermometer inserted into mixture registers 140\u00b0F, about 2 minutes. Transfer egg white mixture to large bowl of stand mixer and beat until stiff peaks form. Fold egg white mixture into warm lemon custard in 3 additions. Transfer mixture to medium bowl; let stand 10 minutes to cool slightly.",
            "Divide lemon custard among prepared souffl\u00e9 dishes; level off tops with back of knife. Refrigerate souffl\u00e9s uncovered overnight. (Can be prepared 2 days ahead. Cover and keep refrigerated.).",
            "Run small knife around souffl\u00e9s to loosen. Place small plate atop 1 souffl\u00e9 and invert. Using both hands, hold plate and souffl\u00e9 dish tightly together and shake gently, allowing souffl\u00e9 to settle on plate (if souffl\u00e9 does not release from dish, place bottom of souffl\u00e9 dish in 1 inch of warm water for 20 seconds). Repeat with remaining souffl\u00e9s. Spoon room-temperature Caramel Sauce generously over top of each souffl\u00e9 and serve."
