            "1/4 teaspoon hot smoked paprika (piment&ocuten picante)",
            "4 cups chicken stock or reduced-sodium chicken broth",
            "1/2 cup tomato juice",
            "1 cup long-grain white rice (preferably Carolina Gold)",

        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Cook bacon in a 4-quart heavy pot over low heat until some of fat is rendered, about 5 minutes. Add onion, celery, and garlic and cook, stirring occasionally, until vegetables are softened but not browned, 7 to 8 minutes. Stir in spices.",
            "Add stock and tomato juice and bring to a boil. Stir in rice and simmer, uncovered, stirring occasionally, until most of liquid is absorbed and rice is cooked through, 20 to 25 minutes (rice will be moist rather than fluffy and dry). Stir in celery leaves, butter, kosher salt, and pepper to taste, then remove from heat and let stand 5 minutes."
