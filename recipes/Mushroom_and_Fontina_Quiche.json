            "1 refrigerated pie crust (half of 15-ounce package)",
            "2 tablespoons (1/4 stick) butter",
            "2/3 cup chopped shallots (about 3 medium)",
            "5 cups sliced assorted mushrooms (such as chanterelle, stemmed shiitake, oyster, crimini, and button; 12 to 14 ounces), large mushrooms halved",
            "4 large eggs",
            "2/3 cup half and half",
            "1/3 cup whole milk",

        "instructions": [
            "Preheat oven to 450\u00b0F. Unroll crust completely. Press firmly onto bottom and up sides of 9-inch-diameter deep-dish glass pie dish. Bake until light golden brown, pressing on sides of crust with back of spoon if crust begins to slide down sides of dish, about 17 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 325\u00b0F.",
            "Meanwhile, melt butter in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat. Add shallots; saut\u00e9 until beginning to soften, about 2 minutes. Add mushrooms; sprinkle with salt and pepper and saut\u00e9 until mushrooms are tender and beginning to brown, about 8 minutes. Transfer to plate; spread out to cool slightly.",
            "Whisk eggs, half and half, milk, 1/2 teaspoon salt, 1/2 teaspoon pepper, and nutmeg in large bowl to blend. Stir in 1 cup Fontina cheese and saut\u00e9ed mushrooms. Pour filling into crust. Sprinkle remaining 1/2 cup cheese over quiche.",
            "Bake quiche until puffed, golden brown, and just set in center, about 45 minutes. Cool 30 minutes. Cut into wedges."
