        "ingredients": [
            "2 cups basmati rice (14 oz)",
            "2 tablespoons unsalted butter",
            "3 1/3 cups water",
            "1 teaspoon salt"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Rinse rice in several changes of cold water until water runs clear. Drain well in a fine-mesh sieve. Melt butter in a 4-quart heavy pot over moderate heat, then add rice and cook, stirring, 2 minutes. Stir in water and salt and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat to low and cook, covered, until rice is tender and liquid is absorbed, about 20 minutes. Remove from heat. Let stand, covered and undisturbed, 5 minutes. Fluff rice gently with a fork."
