        "title": "Sumac Skirt Steak with Pomegranate Reduction ",
        "ingredients": [
            "2 cups bottled pomegranate juice (16 fl oz)",
            "1 teaspoon sugar",
            "1 teaspoon salt",
            "1 tablespoon sumac",
            "1 teaspoon black pepper",
            "2 lb skirt steak",
            "3 tablespoons unsalted butter",
            "3 tablespoons finely chopped shallot (1 medium)",
            "1/4 cup ruby or tawny Port",
            "1 teaspoon fresh lemon juice"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Bring pomegranate juice, sugar, and 1/4 teaspoon salt to a boil in a 1 1/2- to 2-quart saucepan over moderately high heat, then boil until reduced to about 1/3 cup, 20 to 30 minutes.",
            "Preheat broiler.",
            "Meanwhile, stir together sumac, pepper, and remaining 3/4 teaspoon salt. Cut steak into pieces to fit in a large shallow baking pan and pat dry. Transfer steak to baking pan and sprinkle evenly with sumac mixture, then let stand about 10 minutes.",
            "Broil steaks 3 to 4 inches from heat, turning over once, 2 to 3 minutes total for thinner pieces, 3 to 4 minutes for thicker pieces for medium-rare. Transfer steaks with any pan juices to a large plate and let stand, loosely covered with foil, 10 minutes.",
            "While steak stands, heat 1 tablespoon butter in a 10-inch heavy skillet over moderately high heat until foam subsides, then cook shallot, stirring occasionally, until golden, 3 to 5 minutes. Add Port and simmer until reduced to a glaze, 2 to 3 minutes. Add meat juices accumulated on plate and bring to a simmer. Whisk in pomegranate reduction and lemon juice. Remove from heat and whisk in remaining 2 tablespoons butter until incorporated.",
            "Holding knife at a 45-degree angle, thinly slice steak diagonally and serve with sauce."
