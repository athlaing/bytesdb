            "2 cups unsweetened dried coconut",
            "3 (1/4-ounces) envelopes unflavored gelatin",
            "1 cup water, divided",
            "1 1/2 cups sugar",
            "1 cup light corn syrup",
            "1/4 teaspoon salt",
            "2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract",
            "1/2 teaspoon coconut extract",
            "Equipment: a 9-inch square metal baking pan; a stand mixer fitted with whisk attachment; a candy thermometer"

        "instructions": [
            "Preheat oven to 350\u00b0F with rack in middle.",
            "Toast coconut in a shallow baking pan in oven, stirring occasionally, until golden, 7 to 10 minutes.",
            "Oil 9-inch baking pan, then sprinkle bottom with 1/2 cup toasted coconut.",
            "Sprinkle gelatin over 1/2 cup water in bowl of mixer and let soften while making syrup.",
            "Heat sugar, corn syrup, salt, and remaining 1/2 cup water in a small heavy saucepan over low heat, stirring until sugar has dissolved. Bring to a boil over medium heat, without stirring, washing any sugar crystals down side of pan with a pastry brush dipped in cold water. Put thermometer into syrup and continue boiling, without stirring, until it registers 240\u00b0F (soft-ball stage). Remove from heat and let stand until bubbles dissipate.",
            "With mixer at low speed, pour hot syrup into gelatin in a thin stream down side of bowl. Increase speed to high and beat until very thick, about 15 minutes. Add vanilla and coconut extracts and beat 1 minute more.",
            "Spoon marshmallow over toasted coconut in baking pan and press evenly with dampened fingertips to smooth top (it will be very sticky), then evenly sprinkle top with 1/2 cup toasted coconut.",
            "Let stand, uncovered, at room temperature until firm, about 2 hours.",
            "Run a sharp knife around edge of marshmallow and invert onto a cutting board. Cut into 3/4-inch-wide strips, then cut each strip into 3/4-inch squares.",
            "Put remaining toasted coconut in a small bowl and dredge marshmallows in it to coat completely."
