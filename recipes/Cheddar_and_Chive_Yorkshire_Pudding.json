Whisk eggs to blend in large bowl. Add milk and whisk until well blended. Whisk flour and salt in medium bowl to blend. Gradually whisk flour mixture and remaining 6 tablespoons fat or butter into egg mixture until well blended (some small lumps will remain).

Bake until Yorkshire puddings are puffed and begin to brown, about 25 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 350\u00b0F and bake until puddings are brown, puffed, and crisp around sides, about 20 minutes longer. Transfer Yorkshire puddings to plates. Serve immediately.",
