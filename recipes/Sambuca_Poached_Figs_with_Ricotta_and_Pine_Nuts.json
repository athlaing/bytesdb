            "1 tablespoon olive oil",
            "1/4 cup pine nuts",
            "3/4 cup Sambuca",

        "instructions": [
            "Heat oil in a small skillet over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking, then cook pine nuts, stirring, until golden, about 2 minutes. Transfer to paper towels and season with salt.",
            "Simmer Sambuca with sugar in a saucepan (pan should be just large enough to hold figs upright), stirring until sugar is dissolved. Cut a very thin slice from bottom of each fig and stand figs in liquid in saucepan (figs will not be covered by liquid).",
            "Poach figs at a bare simmer, covered, 5 minutes. Cool slightly in liquid.",
            "Season ricotta with salt and pepper. Divide figs among 4 plates alongside mounds of ricotta and drizzle figs with some of poaching liquid, then sprinkle with pine nuts and serve."
