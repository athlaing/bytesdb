        "title": "Seared Steak With Cipolline Onions And Radicchio ",
        "ingredients": [
            "1 1/2 pounds bavette (or flap) steak, cut into 4 pieces, or one 2\u20132 1/4-inch-thick boneless sirloin (about 2 pounds)",
            "1 pound cipolline onions",
            "1 tablespoon plus 2 teaspoons olive oil; plus more for drizzling",
            "Kosher salt",
            "3 tablespoons unsalted butter",
            "2 cups torn radicchio (such as Castelfranco, Chioggia, and/or Treviso)",
            "2 teaspoons red wine vinegar"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Preheat oven to 350\u00b0F. Let steaks sit at room temperature 1 hour (this will help them cook more quickly and evenly).",
            "Meanwhile, toss onions on a rimmed baking sheet with 1 Tbsp. oil; season with salt. Roast, turning halfway through, until deeply caramelized and tender, 25\u201330 minutes. Keep warm.",
            "Heat a cast-iron or ovenproof skillet over medium-high. Rub steaks with 2 tsp. oil (you want just enough to coat them); season with salt. Cook steaks 25\u201330 seconds. Turn and cook another 25\u201330 seconds. Continue process of cooking and turning steaks until both sides are deeply browned and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part registers 130\u00b0F, 8\u201310 minutes.",
            "Add butter to skillet and cook, tilting pan and spooning melted butter over meat, until steaks look glossy on top. Transfer to a cutting board and let rest 10 minutes before slicing against the grain.",
            "While steaks are resting, toss radicchio and vinegar in a large bowl to combine. Drizzle with oil and season with salt; toss to coat.",
            "Serve steak with onions and radicchio."
