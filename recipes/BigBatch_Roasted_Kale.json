        "title": "Big-Batch Roasted Kale ",
        "ingredients": [
            "4 bunches curly kale (about 2 lb.), rinsed, ribs and stems removed, leaves torn into 1\"\u20131 1/2\" pieces",
            "6 garlic cloves, thinly sliced",
            "1 tsp. (or more) kosher salt",
            "1/2 cup plus 2 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Arrange racks in upper and lower thirds of oven; preheat to 325\u00b0F. Toss kale, garlic, salt, and 1/2 cup oil in a very large bowl. Divide between 2 rimmed baking sheets (it\u2019s okay to pile it on; the kale will steam and wilt as it cooks). Pour 2 Tbsp. water over each. Roast, rotating sheets and tossing halfway through, until leaves are tender and edges are crisped and slightly browned, about 20 minutes.",
            "Transfer kale to a large bowl. Toss with remaining 2 Tbsp. oil. Taste and season with more salt, if needed.",
            "Do Ahead: Kale can be made 1 week ahead. Transfer to an airtight container and chill."
