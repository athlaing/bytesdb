            "Make wonton crisps: Halve each wonton wrapper to make 2 rectangles, then halve each rectangle diagonally to make 2 triangles. Heat 1 1/4 inches vegetable oil in a 4- to 5-quart heavy pot over moderately high heat until thermometer registers 360\u00b0F. Gently lay 4 triangles on oil (do not drop in, or triangles will lose their shape) and fry, turning over once, until just golden, 15 to 30 seconds total. Transfer with a slotted spoon to paper towels to drain and season with salt. Fry remaining triangles in same manner.",
