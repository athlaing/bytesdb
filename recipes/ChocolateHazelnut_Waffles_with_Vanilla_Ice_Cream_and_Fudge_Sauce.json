            "Whisk first 7 ingredients in large bowl to blend. Stir 6 tablespoons warm water and espresso powder in small bowl until powder dissolves. Stir chocolate and butter in heavy medium saucepan over low heat until melted and smooth. Remove from heat. Whisk in oil, vanilla and espresso mixture. Cool to lukewarm. Whisk eggs, then 1 1/4 cups buttermilk and ground hazelnuts into chocolate mixture; add to dry ingredients and whisk to blend well. Preheat waffle iron to medium heat, following manufacturer's instructions. Pour about 1/2 to 3/4 cup batter (depending on size of waffle iron) into center of waffle iron; spread evenly with spatula. Close waffle iron and cook until waffle is cooked through but still soft and color on outside darkens, about 4 minutes (time will vary, depending on waffle iron). Using spatula, transfer waffle to rack. Repeat with remaining batter. (Can be prepared 6 hours ahead. Let waffles stand at room temperature. Before continuing, transfer to baking sheet and rewarm in 400\u00b0F oven until crisp, about 6 minutes.) Stir liqueur into warm Fudge Sauce. Cut each waffle diagonally in half, forming triangles. Arrange 3 waffle triangles on each of 6 plates. Dust with powdered sugar. Place scoop of ice cream atop waffle triangles. Pour Fudge Sauce over waffles and ice cream. Sprinkle with toffee bits and chopped hazelnuts.",
