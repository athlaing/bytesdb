            "Combine onions, tomatillos, nopales, garlic, cheese, and 1/3 cup olive oil in a large resealable plastic bag; season with salt and pepper. Seal bag, pressing out air, and toss to coat. Let sit at least 1 hour. Whisk vinegar, honey, and espresso in a medium bowl until honey and espresso are dissolved. Gradually add remaining 1/3 cup olive oil, whisking constantly. Season with salt and pepper; set aside. Prepare grill for medium-high heat; lightly oil grates. (Or, heat a grill pan over medium-high.) Remove onions, tomatillos, and nopales from marinade; grill, turning occasionally, until tender and charred in spots, about 5 minutes. Let cool. Remove cheese from marinade and grill, turning often, until browned on all sides, 8-10 minutes; let cool. Cut vegetables into bite-size pieces; coarsely chop cheese. Arrange greens on a platter. Season with salt and pepper and drizzle with half of vinaigrette. Top with cucumber, herbs, and grilled vegetables and cheese; drizzle with remaining vinaigrette. Do Ahead: Vinaigrette can be made 2 days ahead. Cover and chill.",
