            "Preheat the oven to 350\u00b0F (175\u00b0C).",
            "In a food processor, pulse the bread until coarse crumbs form. Spread the crumbs on a baking sheet and toss them with the oil, garlic, herbs, and a pinch of salt until evenly coated. Roast the crumbs, tossing occasionally, until they\u2019re golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes. Once cooled, the rye crisps can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 weeks.",
            "Make the vinaigrette: In a mini food processor, pulse all of the ingredients together until they\u2019re well combined and the dressing has emulsified. (You can also whisk the dressing by hand.)",

            "Make the salad: Place the lettuce leaves in a large bowl and scatter them with the torn mint. Pour about 3/4 cup (180 ml) of the vinaigrette over the leaves, gently tossing until well coated, adding more dressing if needed. Transfer the salad to a platter and, using a fine grater, grate on additional cheese. Scatter with the rye crisps and remaining mint, and finish with freshly cracked pepper.",
