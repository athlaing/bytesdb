        "title": "3-Ingredient Buffalo Grilled Chicken Wings ",
        "ingredients": [
            "2 pounds chicken wings (flats and drumettes attached or separated)",
            "1 tablespoon vegetable oil",
            "1 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more",
            "1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, plus more",
            "1/4 cup (1/2 stick) unsalted butter",
            "1/3 cup hot sauce, such as Frank\u2019s"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Pat wings very dry with paper towels. Toss wings, oil, 1 tsp. salt, and 1/2 tsp. pepper in a large bowl to coat.",
            "Melt butter in a small pot over medium-high heat. Remove from heat, stir in hot sauce, and set aside in a warm place.",
            "Prepare a grill for two zones, medium and medium-high, or heat a grill pan over medium. Working in batches if necessary, grill wings over medium heat, turning occasionally, until skin is starting to brown and fat is rendering, about 12 minutes. Move wings to medium-high zone of grill or increase heat under grill pan to medium-high. Cook wings, moving to a cooler section of grill or reducing heat if they start to burn, and brushing with about 1/4 cup hot sauce mixture during last minute of cooking, until cooked through, an instant-read thermometer inserted into the flesh but not touching the bone registers 165\u00b0F, and skin is crisp and lightly charred, 5\u201310 minutes.",
            "Pour remaining sauce into a large bowl, add grilled wings, and toss to coat. Season with salt and pepper and serve immediately."
