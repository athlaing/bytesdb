            "Bring verjus, Port, and sugar to a boil in a 1-quart heavy saucepan, stirring until sugar is dissolved, then boil until syrupy and reduced to about 1/3 cup, 8 to 12 minutes.",
            "Make vinaigrette: Whisk together vinegar, salt, and pepper in a bowl, then add walnut oil in a slow stream, whisking. Just before serving, toss fris\u00e9e, endives, and radicchio in a bowl with just enough vinaigrette to coat.",

            "Just before serving, toss fris\u00e9e, endives, and radicchio in a bowl with just enough vinaigrette to coat.",
            "Make toasts: Put oven rack in upper third of oven and preheat oven to 400\u00b0F. Toast bread slices on a baking sheet, turning over once, until pale golden, about 8 minutes. Cut foie gras terrine into 12 slices (about 1/4 inch thick) and put 1 on each toast (trim toasts to size of foie gras if desired). Sprinkle lightly with fleur de sel, then halve toasts diagonally. Let toasts stand, loosely covered with plastic wrap, 5 to 10 minutes, to bring foie gras to room temperature. Put 1 foie gras toast on each of 12 plates and drizzle with Port glaze, then divide salad among plates.",
