            "Line a baking sheet with foil. Bring sugar and water to a boil in a 3-quart heavy saucepan over moderate heat, stirring until sugar is dissolved. Stir in peanuts and boil, stirring frequently, until syrup thickens, about 8 minutes. Reduce heat to moderately low and stir in 1/4 teaspoon salt. Continue cooking, stirring and scraping any bits of crystallized sugar from side of pan into mixture (it will become very gritty), until sugar is golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes more. (Sugar will still be gritty.)",
