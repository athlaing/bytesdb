            "the zest of 1 navel orange removed with a vegetable peeler",
            "1/2 cup olive oil",
            "1-1/2 teaspoons curry powder",
            "four 6-inch pita loaves",

        "instructions": [
            "In a blender blend the zest with the oil and curry powder until the mixture is smooth and transfer the orange curry oil to a bowl. Split the pita loaves, brush the rough sides with the orange curry oil, and cut the pita halves into 1/4-inch-wide strips. Divide the pita strips between 2 baking sheets, sprinkle them with the salt, and bake them in a preheated 350\u00b0F. oven, turning them occasionally, for 10 to 12 minutes, or until they are golden. The pita crisps keep in an airtight container for 5 days."
