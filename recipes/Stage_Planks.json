            "3-3 1/2 cups all-purpose flour",
            "1 tablespoon ground ginger",
            "1 teaspoon cinnamon",
            "1/2 teaspoon ground cloves",
            "1 teaspoon baking soda",
            "1 cup buttermilk",
            "1/4 teaspoon salt",
            "3/4 cup molasses",
            "1/4 cup sugar",
            "6 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Preheat oven to 375\u00b0F. Line 2 cookie sheets with parchment paper and set aside. In a medium bowl, sift together 3 cups flour, ginger, cinnamon, cloves, baking soda, and salt. Set aside. In bowl of a standing mixer, add molasses, sugar, and butter. Mix on medium-high speed until color turns lighter, about 2 minutes. On low mixer speed, alternate flour and buttermilk with butter mixture. Raise speed to medium and mix 30 seconds. Dough should be stiff enough to roll out. If not, mix in up to 1/2 cup more flour to reach proper consistency.",
            "On a hard floured surface, roll dough to a 10\" x 16\" rectangle. Slice down the middle horizontally, then vertically at 2-inch intervals to make 16 cookies. Place individual pieces at least 1 inch apart on prepared cookie sheets. Bake until tops are firm, about 15 minutes. Remove from oven and cool completely in pans."
