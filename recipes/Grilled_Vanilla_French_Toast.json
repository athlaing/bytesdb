            "1 tablespoon vanilla extract",
            "2 cups half and half",

        "instructions": [
            "Light a grill or preheat a grill pan. In a shallow baking dish, whisk the eggs with the sugar, salt and vanilla extract. Whisk in the half-and-half. Working in batches, add the slices of bread to the egg mixture and turn to coat; let stand until well soaked, 1 to 2 minutes. Lightly oil the grill grates, then grill the soaked bread over moderately high heat until dark brown grill marks form on the bottom, about 2 minutes. Flip and grill for about 2 minutes longer, until the French toast is cooked through. Transfer to plates and serve with butter and maple syrup or jam.",
