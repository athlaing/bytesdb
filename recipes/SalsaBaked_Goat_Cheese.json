        "title": "Salsa-Baked Goat Cheese ",
        "ingredients": [
            "1/4 cup pine nuts or coarsely chopped walnuts or pecans",
            "1 4-ounce log goat cheese (there are flavored goat cheeses available, some of which can be good with the salsa, but think about the flavor combination before making your purchase)",
            "1 3-ounce package cream cheese, softened",
            "1 cup Roasted Jalape\u00f1o-Tomato Salsa",
            "A tablespoon or so chopped fresh cilantro, for garnish"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "1. Heat the oven to 350 degrees. Spread out the nuts on a baking sheet and toast them in the oven until lightly browned and very fragrant, 7 or 8 minutes (the pine nuts will brown quicker than either of the others). Remove and slide them off into a medium-size bowl.",
            "2. Add the cheeses to the bowl and combine thoroughly with the nuts. Scoop it in the center of a baking dish (I like to use a decorative 9-inch pie pan) and form it into a 5-inch-diameter disk. Spoon the salsa over and around the cheese. Place the dish in the oven and bake until heated through, 10 to 15 minutes. Sprinkle on the cilantro and set it out for your guests to enjoy as a dip or a spread."
