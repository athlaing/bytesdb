            "1. Prepare a hot fire in a grill. 2. To make the vinaigrette, whisk all the ingredients in a small bowl until well blended. Set aside. (Vinaigrette can be made up to 4 days ahead of time and stored, covered, in the refrigerator.) 3. Arrange the oysters in their half shells on a large baking sheet. Spoon about 1 teaspoon vinaigrette over each oyster and bring out to the grill. Add the wood chips to the coals or place the smoker box or packet close to a gas jet on a gas grill. When you see the first wisp of smoke, quickly arrange the oysters on the grill grate. Close the lid and grill for 3 to 5 minutes or until the edges of the oysters have begun to curl. 4. Arrange the oysters on plates or a platter and serve, passing extra vinaigrette at the table.",
