        "ingredients": [
            "3/4 cup tapenade*",
            "4 teaspoons chopped fresh rosemary",
            "2 2-inch-thick porterhouse steaks (about 2 pounds each)",
            "4 teaspoons olive oil",
            "4 tablespoons balsamic vinegar"

        "instructions": [
            "Preheat oven to 400\u00b0F. Mix tapenade and rosemary in small bowl to blend. Sprinkle steaks with salt and generously with cracked black pepper.",
            "Divide olive oil between 2 heavy medium ovenproof skillets set over high heat. Add 1 steak to each skillet and cook until both are browned, about 3 minutes per side. Spread half of tapenade mixture atop each steak. Transfer skillets with steaks to oven. Cook both steaks until thermometer inserted into center of steaks registers 125\u00b0F for medium-rare, about 20 minutes. Transfer both steaks to platter. Pour 2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar into each skillet and cook over medium heat until liquid is slightly reduced, scraping up browned bits, about 1 minute. Drizzle hot skillet juices over each steak and serve.",
