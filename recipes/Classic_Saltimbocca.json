            "1 1/2 pounds veal scaloppine, pounded to 1/4-inch thickness",
            "1/4 pound (about) thinly sliced prosciutto",
            "1 large bunch fresh sage (with large leaves)",

Working in batches and adding more butter as needed (reserving 1 tablespoon), cook veal in single layer, prosciutto side down, until brown, about 1 minute. Using spatula, carefully turn veal over, keeping sage leaf intact. Cook until brown, about 1 minute longer. Transfer to rimmed baking sheet; keep warm in oven.",
