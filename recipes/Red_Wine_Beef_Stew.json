        "ingredients": [
            "4 pounds chuck roast, cut into 2-inch pieces",
            "1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt",
            "1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper",
            "3 tablespoons all-purpose flour",
            "1 tablespoon olive oil",
            "1/4 cup tomato paste",
            "2 cups dry red wine, such as Pinot Noir or Syrah",
            "4 cups low-sodium chicken broth",
            "1 medium yellow onion, quartered",
            "2 bay leaves",
            "4 sprigs thyme",
            "10 medium carrots (about 2 pounds), peeled and cut into 3-inch pieces",
            "1 1/2 pounds baby white or red potatoes, halved"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Preheat the oven to 325\u00b0F.",
            "Season the meat with salt and pepper, place in a large bowl, and toss with the flour.",
            "Heat the oil in a large Dutch oven or wide-bottomed pot with a tight-fitting lid over medium-high heat. Cook the meat, in batches, until well browned on all sides, 6 to 8 minutes, transferring the pieces to a plate as they are browned. Pour off and discard any drippings from the pot.",
            "Add the tomato paste, wine, broth, onion, bay leaves, thyme, and 2 of the carrots and bring to a boil. Return the meat and any juices back to the pot (the meat should be barely submerged in liquid), cover, and transfer to the oven. Cook for 2 hours.",
            "Using tongs, remove and discard the cooked vegetables. Add the potatoes and the remaining 8 carrots to the pot, cover, and return to the oven. Cook until the meat and vegetables are fork-tender, about 1 hour more."
