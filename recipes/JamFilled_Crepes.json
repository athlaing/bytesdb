            "1 cup plus 2 tablespoons whole milk",
            "2 large eggs",
            "1 cup all-purpose flour",
            "2 tablespoons granulated sugar",
            "3 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon unsalted butter, melted and cooled slightly",
            "1/4 teaspoon salt",
            "About 2/3 cup apricot or strawberry jam (from a 10- to 12-oz jar)",
            "1 tablespoon brandy",
            "Confectioners sugar (preferably vanilla sugar) for dusting (see cooks' note)",
            "a 10-inch nonstick skillet"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Blend milk, eggs, flour, granulated sugar, 2 tablespoons butter, and salt in a blender, scraping down side once or twice, until batter is smooth, about 1 minute. Let batter stand at room temperature 1 hour (this prevents tough cr\u00eapes). Stir together jam and brandy in a small bowl.",
            "Preheat oven to 250\u00b0F.",
            "Add 1/2 teaspoon butter to skillet and brush to coat bottom. Heat over moderate heat until hot, about 30 seconds, then pour 1/4 cup batter into skillet, tilting to coat bottom evenly. Cook until underside is pale golden, 11/2 to 2 minutes, then jerk skillet to loosen cr\u00eape and flip cr\u00eape with a spatula. Cook until underside is pale golden, 30 seconds to 1 minute. Transfer cr\u00eape with spatula to a work surface, turning over so that side cooked first is facedown. Spread cr\u00eape all over with 1 tablespoon jam and roll up jelly-roll style. Transfer to a heatproof platter and keep warm in oven. Make 7 more cr\u00eapes in same manner, transferring to oven (rolled cr\u00eapes can be arranged side by side or stacked like logs). Dust generously with vanilla sugar."
