            "Preheat the broiler, with a rack positioned so that the meat will be 3 to 4 inches (7.5 to 10 cm) from the heat. Line the bottom of a broiler pan with foil for easier clean-up, if you like, then top with the broiler rack. Put the meat on the broiler rack, lightly coat with the oil, and season with salt and pepper. Broil the meat for 5 to 7 minutes per side for medium-rare (err on the side of caution with the time; you can always cook it more). Transfer to a cutting board, sprinkle with salt, and let rest for 5 to 10 minutes.",
            "Meanwhile, in a large bowl, combine the lettuce, cucumbers, tomatoes, onions, mint, and cilantro.*",
            "Cut the meat against the grain into very thin slices and add to the bowl. (If the meat is still hot, wait a few minutes until it is warm or it will wilt the lettuce and herbs.) Drizzle the salad with just enough Chile-Lime Sauce to lightly coat and gently toss together. Top with the peanuts, if you like.",
            "Make Ahead Prepare to *, then cover and refrigerate the lettuce mixture and the unsliced meat separately for up to 1 day. The meat can be sliced and added to the salad cold or you can warm it in a 300\u00b0F (150\u00b0C) oven, if you prefer.",
