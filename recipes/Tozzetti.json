            "1 tablespoon baking powder",
            "1/4 teaspoon kosher salt",
            "1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour plus more for work surface",
            "3/4 cup sugar",
            "1/4 cup (1/2 stick) unsalted butter, room temperature",
            "2 large eggs",
            "1 1/4 cups blanched almonds"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Preheat oven to 325\u00b0. Whisk baking powder, salt, and 1 3/4 cups flour in a medium bowl; set aside. Using an electric mixer on medium-high, beat sugar and butter in a medium bowl until creamy, about 2 minutes. Add eggs one at a time, beating to blend between additions and occasionally scraping sides of bowl, until combined. Reduce speed to low, add dry ingredients, and mix just to blend. Fold in almonds.",
            "Transfer dough to a lightly floured work surface and knead just to bring together, about 2 times. Form into a log about 14\" long, 2\" wide, and 1\" thick. Place log on a parchment-lined baking sheet.",
            "Bake until puffed, cracked in spots, and starting to brown, 25-30 minutes. Transfer baking sheet to a wire rack and let log cool.",
            "Using a serrated knife, slice log diagonally 1/2\" thick. Arrange slices on same sheet; bake until golden brown, 15-20 minutes. Turn and bake until other side is golden brown, 5-10 minutes longer. Transfer baking sheet to a wire rack. Let tozzetti cool.",
            "DO AHEAD: Tozzetti can be made 1 week ahead. Store airtight at room temperature."
