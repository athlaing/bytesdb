            "1 cup all-purpose flour",
            "1 1/2 cups yellow cornmeal",
            "1 tablespoon double-acting baking powder",
            "1 teaspoon salt",
            "1 cup milk",

        "instructions": [
            "In a bowl whisk together the flour, the cornmeal, the baking powder, and the salt. In a small bowl whisk together the milk, the egg, and the butter, and stir the mixture into the cornmeal mixture, stirring until the batter is just combined. Pour the batter into a greased 8-inch-square baking pan and bake the corn bread in the middle of a preheated 425\u00b0F. oven for 20 to 25 minutes, or until the top is pale golden and a tester comes out clean. Let the corn bread cool in the pan for 5 minutes, invert it onto a rack, and let it cool completely. Crumble the corn bread coarse into 2 shallow baking pans and toast it in the middle of a preheated 325\u00b0F. oven, stirring occasionally, for 30 to 35 minutes, or until it is dried and deep golden."
