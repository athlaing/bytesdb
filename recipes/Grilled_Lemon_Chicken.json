            "Combine all ingredients except chicken in a blender and blend until emulsified.",
            "Prepare chicken: Put chicken pieces in a nonreactive bowl or dish or a large sealable plastic bag. Add marinade and turn chicken once or twice to coat. Marinate, covered and chilled, at least 8 hours. Bring chicken to room temperature 30 minutes before grilling and discard marinade.",

            "To cook chicken using a charcoal grill: Open vents on bottom of grill and on lid. Light a large chimney starter of charcoal (80 to 100 briquettes). Leaving about one quarter of grill free of charcoal, bank lit charcoal across rest of grill so that coals are about 3 times higher on opposite side. When charcoal turns grayish white (about 15 to 20 minutes) and you can hold your hand 5 inches above rack for 3 to 4 seconds, sear chicken on lightly oiled grill rack over coals, uncovered, turning occasionally, until browned, 4 to 8 minutes total. Move chicken to side of grill with no coals underneath and cook, covered with lid, turning occasionally, until just cooked through, about 12 minutes for wings, 18 to 20 minutes for breasts, and 20 to28 minutes for dark meat. Transfer chicken as cooked to a platter.",
