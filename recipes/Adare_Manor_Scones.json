            "Preheat oven to 425\u00b0F. Whisk baking powder, salt, and 1 1/2 cups flour in a large bowl. Add butter and blend with your fingertips until pea-size pieces form. Add milk and sugar and mix with a fork until a shaggy dough forms. Transfer dough to a lightly floured surface and gently knead until dough just comes together, 3 or 4 times.",
            "Gently pat dough into a 1\"-thick round. Using a 2\" round biscuit cutter or inverted small glass, cut out scones. Gather scraps and repeat, patting out and cutting to make 10 scones. Transfer to a parchmentlined rimmed baking sheet and brush with egg.",
            "Bake scones until golden brown, 15-20 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack. Serve warm or at room temperature, split, with clotted cream, jam, and/or lemon curd.",
            "DO AHEAD: Scones can be made 8 hours ahead. Let cool completely and store airtight at room temperature."
