            "2 tablespoons hot chili paste (sambal oelek)",
            "1 tablespoon unseasoned rice vinegar",
            "1 teaspoon honey",
            "1/4 cup labneh (Lebanese strained yogurt) or plain Greek yogurt",
            "Kosher salt",
            "3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil",
            "2 large eggs",
            "2 warm tortillas",

        "instructions": [
            "Mix hot chili paste, vinegar, and honey in a small bowl. Place labneh in another small bowl; season with salt.",
            "Heat oil in a medium nonstick skillet over medium-high. Crack eggs into pan and cook, shaking pan occasionally to keep eggs from sticking to each other, until edges are golden brown, about 2 minutes; season with salt. Carefully tilt skillet toward you so oil pools at front edge of pan. Spoon oil over egg whites, especially where they are still translucent, avoiding yolks, until set, about 1 minute.",
