            "2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil",
            "2 large garlic cloves, finely chopped",
            "2 teaspoon chopped thyme",
            "1 Turkish or 1/2 California bay leaf",
            "3 (3-by 1-inch) strips orange zest",
            "3 pounds bok choy (2 to 3 heads), cut crosswise into 2-inch pieces",
