            "Flourless cooking spray, for greasing",
            "1 cup sugar",
            "3/4 cup packed light brown sugar",
            "1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, cut into small cubes, at room temperature",
            "2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour",
            "1 teaspoon baking soda",
            "1 teaspoon salt",
            "2 large eggs, at room temperature",
            "1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract",
            "2 cups bittersweet chocolate chunks or chips"

        "instructions": [
            "1. Preheat the oven to 350\u00b0F. Lightly spray cookie sheets with cooking spray or line them with parchment paper. In a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat together the sugars and butter on medium speed until light in texture and smooth, about 2 minutes. While that mixture is beating, sift the flour, baking soda, and salt into a bowl and set aside. 2. Add the eggs, one at a time, to the sugar-butter mixture, followed by the vanilla, and blend until incorporated. With the mixer on low or using a wooden spoon, stir in the sifted dry ingredients. Scrape down the bowl as needed to blend evenly. Stir in the chocolate chunks. 3. Using 2 spoons, drop the dough onto the prepared baking sheets, about 2 inches apart. If desired, slightly flatten the cookies before baking. 4. Bake the cookies in batches, rotating the pans halfway through baking, until they are cracked on top but still slightly moist, 12 to 15 minutes. Transfer the cookies to wire racks and let cool completely.",
