Transfer to 9 1/2-inch deep-dish glass pie dish; discard paper. Trim overhang to 1/2 inch. Crimp edges. Refrigerate 20 minutes. (Optional garnish: Gather dough scraps and roll out on lightly floured surface to thickness of 1/8 inch. Cut out fourteen 3-inch-long leaves with knife or cutter. Refrigerate leaves until ready to use.)",
