Strain through a fine-mesh sieve into a small bowl. Cover and chill hibiscus tea until cold, at least 1 hour. Meanwhile, blend quartered strawberries in a blender until finely pur\u00e9ed. Transfer to a large bowl; add tea, agave syrup, and 1 tablespoon lime juice. Season to taste, adding more agave and lime juice, if desired. Pour strawberry mixture into a 13x9x2\" metal pan and freeze until top layer begins to harden, about 2 hours. Using a fork, scrape mixture to break frozen portions into tiny pieces. Freeze for 30 minutes; scrape again. Repeat until granita resembles fluffy shaved ice, about 4 hours. Divide among bowls. Garnish with basil leaves and diced strawberries.",
