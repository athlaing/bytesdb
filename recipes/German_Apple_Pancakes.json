            "1/4 cup plus 2 teaspoons sugar",
            "1/2 teaspoon cinnamon",
            "1 cup all-purpose flour",
            "1/2 teaspoon salt",
            "1 1/2 cups whole milk",
            "4 large eggs",
            "1 1/2 lb Gala apples (3 or 4)",
            "2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice",
            "3/4 stick (6 tablespoons) unsalted butter, cut into 12 pieces",
            "an adjustable-blade slicer"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Preheat oven to 200\u00b0F.",
            "Stir together 1/4 cup sugar and cinnamon and set aside.",
            "Whisk together flour, salt, and remaining 2 teaspoons sugar in a large bowl. Add milk in a slow stream, whisking, then add eggs, 1 at a time, whisking well after each addition.",
            "Peel apples, then cut into 1/8-inch thick slices with slicer, rotating around core (discard core). Cut apple slices into 1/8-inch-thick matchsticks and toss with lemon juice in a bowl. Fold apples and juice into batter.",
            "Heat 1 piece butter (1/2 tablespoon) in a 6-inch nonstick skillet over moderate heat until foam subsides, then add 1/3 cup batter, spreading evenly to cover bottom. Cook, reducing heat if browning too quickly and turning pancake over once with a thin flexible heatproof spatula, until golden on both sides, about 4 minutes total. Slide pancake onto a platter and keep warm in oven. Make more pancakes with remaining butter and batter in same manner. Sprinkle with cinnamon sugar and serve immediately."
