        "instructions": [
            "Position a rack in the lower third of the oven and preheat the oven to 400\u00b0F. Butter a 9-inch cast-iron skillet or 9-inch deep-dish pie pan.",
            "To make the fruit filling, rub the sugar, cornstarch, and salt together in a large bowl, then add the pears and lemon juice and toss until evenly coated.",
            "Gently fold in the raspberries, then transfer the fruit to the prepared pan.",
            "Distribute the butter atop the fruit.",
            "To make the biscuit, whisk the flour, 3 tablespoons of the sugar, the baking powder, and salt together in a bowl. Add the butter and toss until evenly coated. Using your fingertips or a pastry blender, cut in the butter until the size of large peas. (Alternatively, you can put the dry ingredients in a food processor and pulse to combine. Add the butter and pulse until the butter is the size of large peas, then transfer to a bowl). Stir in the candied ginger, then pour in the 2\u20443 cup buttermilk and stir just until the dry ingredients are moistened. The dough will be crumbly, with large pieces of butter still visible. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured work surface and gently press the dough together, then press it into a 9-inch circle.",
