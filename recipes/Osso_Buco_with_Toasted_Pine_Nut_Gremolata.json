        "ingredients": [
            "1 whole veal shank, 3 to 3 1/2 pounds",
            "Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper",
            "6 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil",
            "1 medium carrot, cut in 1/4-inch-thick coins",
            "1 small Spanish onion, diced",
            "1 celery stalk, cut in 1/4-inch slices",
            "Leaves from 1 bunch of fresh thyme, chopped",
            "2 cups basic tomato sauce",
            "2 cups brown chicken stock",
            "2 cups dry white wine",
            "Leaves from 1 bunch of flat-leaf parsley",
            "1/2 cup pine nuts, toasted at 400\u00b0F. for 2 minutes",
            "Zest of 1 lemon",

            "Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "1. Preheat oven to 375\u00b0F.",
            "2. Season the shank all over with salt and pepper. In a heavy-bottomed, 6- to 8-quart casserole, heat the olive oil until smoking. Place the shank in the pan and brown all over for 12 to 15 minutes, turning with long-handled tongs to sear every surface. Remove the shank and set aside.",
            "3. Reduce the heat to medium, add the carrot, onion, celery, and thyme, and cook, stirring regularly, until golden brown and slightly softened, 8 to 10 minutes. Add the tomato sauce, chicken stock, and wine and bring to a boil. Return the shanks to the pan, making sure they are submerged at least halfway; if not, add more stock. Cover the pan with a tight-fitting lid of aluminum foil. Braise in the oven for 2 hours, then remove the cover and cook another 30 minutes, until the meat is nearly falling off the bone.",
            "4. Just before the meat is done make the gremolata. In a small bowl, combine the parsley leaves, pine nuts, lemon zest, and horseradish and mix well by hand. Sprinkle with a little salt and pepper and set aside.",
            "5. Remove the casserole from the oven and let stand for 10 minutes before carving the shank and dividing among four warmed dinner plates, topped with the gremolata."
