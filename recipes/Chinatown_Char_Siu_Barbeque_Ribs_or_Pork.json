        "instructions": [
            "Combine the marinade ingredients in a bowl and whisk thoroughly. Place the meat in a resealable plastic bag (you may need more than one), add the marinade, seal tightly, and toss to coat. Refrigerate for at least 3 hours or overnight.",
            "Heat your cooker to 300\u00b0F. (You can also use an indoor oven. Just place the ribs on a wire grate over a pan or on a broiler pan.) If you are using a gas grill, turn off one or two burners and place the meat over the cool burners. If you are using a charcoal grill, set it up by banking the coals against one side for indirect cooking. Remove the ribs from the marinade and cook for about 1 hour; then paint the bone side of the ribs with a coat of the honey or char siu sauce. Cook for 10 minutes, underside up; then turn meat side up, paint with more honey or char siu sauce, and cook for another 10 minutes. Remove the ribs, let them sit for 5 minutes, cut them into individual ribs, and serve hot, garnished with chopped fresh chives."
