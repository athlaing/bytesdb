        "ingredients": [
            "2 Roma tomatoes",
            "2 fresh jalape\u00f1os",
            "1 clove garlic, unpeeled",
            "Kosher salt"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "On a comal or in a cast-iron skillet over moderately high heat, dry-roast the tomatoes, jalape\u00f1os, and garlic. When the garlic's papery outer skin starts to brown, remove the garlic from the pan and carefully peel it, discarding the skin. Continue roasting the tomatoes and jalape\u00f1os until soft and blackened on all sides. Transfer to a plate to cool. Peel the jalape\u00f1os and remove the stems. (Jalape\u00f1os can be spicy and leave their heat on your hands, so wear gloves or use caution when handling.) Peel and core the tomatoes.",
            "Place the jalape\u00f1os and garlic in a molcajete, blender, or food processor and season with the salt. Grind with the pestle or process until a paste forms. Add the tomatoes, one at a time, and grind or process until smooth. Season generously with salt."
