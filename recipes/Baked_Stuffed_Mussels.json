            "Preheat oven to 450\u00b0F with rack in middle. Bring water with mussels to a boil in a wide 5-quart heavy pot, covered, then boil, covered, shaking pot occasionally, until mussels just open wide, 3 to 4 minutes. (Discard any unopened mussels.) Transfer to a bowl with a slotted spoon, reserving cooking liquid, and cool to room temperature. Put 48 half mussel shells with mussels attached in a large shallow baking pan (discard other halves) and drizzle with some of reserved cooking liquid. Stir together remaining ingredients, then top each mussel with about 1 teaspoon of mixture. Bake until crumbs are golden and crisp, about 5 minutes.",
