        "ingredients": [
            "2 pounds mixed small or medium beets (such as Chioggia, red, and/or golden), scrubbed",
            "6 tablespoons olive oil, divided, plus more",
            "Kosher salt, freshly ground pepper",
            "2 tablespoons finely grated lemon zest",
            "2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice",
            "1/4 cup (lightly packed) fresh mint leaves, plus more",
            "2 tablespoons torn fresh dill, plus more",
            "1/2 cup labneh (Lebanese strained yogurt) or plain Greek yogurt",
            "Flaky sea salt (such as Maldon)"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Preheat oven to 400\u00b0. Divide beets between 2 large sheets of foil. Drizzle beets on each sheet with 1/2 tablespoon oil; season with kosher salt and pepper and wrap up foil around beets. Roast on a rimmed baking sheet until tender, 40-50 minutes. Let cool slightly, then, using a paper towel, rub skins from beets (they should slip off easily). Crush beets with the bottom of a small bowl (it's alright if they fall apart). Meanwhile, whisk lemon zest, lemon juice, and 2 tablespoons oil in a large bowl; set vinaigrette aside. Heat 3 tablespoons oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add beets, season with kosher salt and pepper, and cook until browned, about 4 minutes per side. Transfer to bowl with vinaigrette, add 1/4 cup mint and 2 tablespoons dill, and toss to coat. Serve beets and dollops of labneh drizzled with more oil, topped with more herbs, and seasoned with pepper and sea salt.",
