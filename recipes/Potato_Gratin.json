        "title": "Potato Gratin ",
        "ingredients": [
            "3 pounds russet (Idaho) potatoes of uniform size",
            "2 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened",
            "1 medium garlic clove, crushed through a press",
            "1 1/2 to 2 cups half-and-half or milk",
            "Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste",
            "Freshly grated nutmeg to taste",
            "4 tablespoons cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche (optional)",
            "1/3 to 1/2 cup heavy cream",
            "1/4 cup Parmesan cheese"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "1. Peel and wash the potatoes and slice them into rounds 1/8 inch thick, using a mandoline, the slicing disk of a food processor, or a sharp knife.",
            "2. Generously butter a 9 by 12-inch heavy shallow baking dish, preferably earthenware or cast-enamel, or an oval gratin dish of comparable size. (You can also use a 12-inch cast-iron skillet.) Rub the dish with half of the crushed garlic.",
            "3. In a small saucepan, bring the half-and-half to a simmer with the remaining garlic and season generously with salt and pepper. Set aside.",
            "4. Preheat the oven to 350\u00b0F. Arrange the potatoes in one overlapping layer on the bottom of the dish. Season the layer generously with salt, pepper, and nutmeg. Arrange two more layers on top, seasoning each layer liberally. You might not need all the potatoes. Press the layers down to compact them. Pour in enough half-and-half to come up just a little below the top layer of potatoes. Set the baking dish on a larger baking sheet, cover with foil, and bake until the potatoes feel tender when pierced with a knife, about 1 hour.",
            "5. Raise the oven temperature to 425\u00b0F, remove the foil, and bake until the top begins to brown, about 10 minutes. Pour just enough cream to cover the top, dab it with cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche, if using, and sprinkle evenly with the Parmesan. Bake until the top is brown and bubbly, 15 to 20 minutes more. Remove from the oven and let the potatoes stand for 10 minutes to absorb the cream. Cut into squares and serve."
