        "instructions": [
            "In a medium, deep saut\u00e9 pan over moderate heat, melt the butter. Add the shallot rings and saut\u00e9 until translucent, about 8 minutes. Add the sugar and vinegar and continue cooking until amber in color and thickened to the consistency of molasses, about 20 minutes. DO AHEAD: The shallots can be made in advance and refrigerated, in an airtight container, up to 3 days.",
            "Make the peppered spaetzle: Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil and keep at a bare simmer. Fill a large bowl with very cold ice water. In a second large bowl, whisk together the flour, salt, and pepper. In a blender, combine the eggs, sour cream, and 1 cup water. Pur\u00e9e until smooth then add to the flour mixture and stir to combine (the consistency should be a little thicker than pancake batter, so adjust with more flour or more water as needed). Working over barely simmering water, force half the batter through a spaetzlemaker, food mill, or colander. Let the spaetzle float to the surface\u2014this will take about 1 minute\u2014wait 30 seconds, then use a mesh skimmer or slotted spoon and transfer the spaetzle to the bowl of ice water. Once cool, transfer the spaetzle to a colander to drain. Repeat with the remaining batter. DO AHEAD: Spaetzle can be made in advance and refrigerated, in an airtight container, up to 2 days.",

The cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche should have an intense pepper note, so add more pepper to taste if necessary.

            "Make the black trumpet pur\u00e9e: In a large saut\u00e9 pan over moderately high heat, heat 1 1/2 tablespoons olive oil until hot but not smoking. Add 1/2 the mushrooms and saut\u00e9 until golden brown, about 1 minute. Add 1/2 the garlic, shallots, and thyme and continue saut\u00e9ing until the shallots are tender, 1 to 2 minutes. Add 3 tablespoons of vinegar and continue cooking until the vinegar is almost completely evaporated, about 30 seconds. Transfer to a large bowl and repeat with the remaining olive oil, mushrooms, garlic, shallots, thyme, and vinegar. Once all the mushrooms are saut\u00e9ed, reserve about 1/2 cup. Transfer the remaining mushrooms to a blender, add the beef stock, and pur\u00e9e until smooth. With the blender on, slowly add the grapeseed oil and truffle oil, if using, and continue processing until the sauce is smooth, aerated, and emulsified, about 3 minutes. Season with salt and pepper and a splash of vinegar if necessary.",
