        "ingredients": [
            "1 large egg white",
            "1/4 cup packed light brown sugar",
            "1/2 teaspoon instant coffee granules, crushed",
            "1 cup walnut pieces (3 1/2 ounces), coarsely chopped if desired",
            "1 cup granulated sugar",
            "1/4 cup water",
            "6 Tablespoons Irish whiskey",
            "1/4 cup heavy cream",
            "1/4 teaspoon salt",
            "2 pints good-quality coffee ice cream"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Preheat oven to 325\u00b0F with rack in middle. Line a rimmed sheet pan with a nonstick baking liner, or line it with foil and lightly oil foil.",
            "Whisk egg white with sugar, coffee powder, and a pinch of salt in a bowl until blended. Stir in walnuts until coated. Spread mixture into a 10- by 8-inch rectangle in pan.",
            "Bake until crisp is dry to the touch, 20 to 25 minutes. Transfer pan to a rack to cool completely.",
            "Loosen crisp with a metal spatula and break into small pieces.",
            "Make sauce: Bring sugar and water to a boil in a 2-quart heavy saucepan over medium-high heat, stirring until sugar is dissolved. Boil without stirring, but washing down any sugar crystals with a brush dipped in cold water, until syrup begins to turn golden, about 5 minutes. Continue to boil, swirling pan occasionally, until syrup is a deep golden caramel. Remove pan from heat and carefully add whiskey, cream, and salt (mixture will bubble up and steam and caramel will harden). Return pan to heat and simmer, stirring, until caramel is dissolved and sauce is smooth. Cool to warm. Serve sauce over scoops of coffee ice cream then sprinkle with walnut crisp.",
