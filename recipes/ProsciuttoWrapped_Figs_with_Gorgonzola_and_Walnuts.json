        "title": "Prosciutto-Wrapped Figs with Gorgonzola and Walnuts ",
        "ingredients": [
            "9 large fresh black Mission figs, stemmed, halved",
            "18 1x5-inch thin strips prosciutto (about 3 ounces)",
            "3 tablespoons Gorgonzola cheese",
            "18 large walnut pieces, toasted"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Preheat broiler. Cover large rimmed baking sheet with foil. Wrap each fig half with 1 prosciutto strip; place on prepared sheet. Broil until prosciutto chars slightly on edges, about 1 1/2 minutes. Turn figs; broil about 1 1/2 minutes longer, watching closely to prevent burning. Place 1/2 teaspoon Gorgonzola atop each fig half. Top each with walnut piece. Serve warm or at room temperature."
