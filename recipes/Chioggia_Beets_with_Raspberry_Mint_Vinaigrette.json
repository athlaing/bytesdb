        "title": "Chioggia Beets with Raspberry Mint Vinaigrette ",
        "ingredients": [
            "1 lb beets (4 to 6; preferably Chioggia*), 1 inch of stems left intact",
            "3 tablespoons thinly sliced scallions",
            "2 to 2 1/2 tablespoons raspberry vinegar",
            "2 teaspoons fresh lemon juice, or to taste",
            "2 tablespoons chopped fresh mint",
            "1 tablespoon finely grated fresh orange zest (from 2 oranges)",
            "1/2 teaspoon salt",
            "1/2 teaspoon black pepper",
            "1/4 cup olive oil",
            "Garnish: fresh mint sprigs"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Cover beets with water by 1 inch in a 2- to 3-quart saucepan and simmer until tender when pierced in center with a fork, about 30 minutes. Drain in a colander and rinse under cold running water. Let stand until cool enough to handle, then slip off and discard skins. Cut beets into 1/4-inch-thick slices.",
            "While beets are cooking, stir together scallions, 2 tablespoons vinegar, lemon juice to taste, mint, zest, salt, and pepper in a bowl. Add oil in a slow stream, whisking until combined. Add warm beets and toss with vinaigrette and vinegar and salt to taste. Serve warm or slightly chilled.",
            "*Sometimes called candy-cane beets, chioggias become more aggressive in flavor as they age, so search out relatively young beets, with a diameter of 1 1/2 to 2 inches."
