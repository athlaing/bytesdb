Turn your oven to broil and skewer the cubes on the chopsticks. If the chopsticks are not lacquered then place them in water for an hour before use, so they won't char in the oven. 3. Grill the skewers in the top of your oven for about 12 minutes or until completely cooked through. Turn after half the time.",

            "Simplify: The sauce tastes better the longer it gets to absorb the flavors, so it can easily be prepared the day before. The same goes for the marinated skewers. Prepare and marinate the day before and just grill before the guests arrive.",

            "For a challenge: If you have access to a grill, then of course that adds to the flavor. Don't forget to soak nonlacquered skewers beforehand so that they don't catch fire.",
