        "title": "Spicy Steamed Mussels with Garlic Bread ",
        "ingredients": [
            "3 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon extra-virgin olive oil, divided",
            "4 slices peasant bread, each about 1 1/2 inches thick (or 1 baguette, sliced in half, lengthwise)",
            "1 whole garlic clove plus 15 cloves garlic, thinly sliced",
            "4 scallions, thinly sliced on a diagonal",
            "2 teaspoons salt",
            "2 pounds Prince Edward Island mussels (or other black mussels)",
            "2 cups tomato puree",
            "1 cup dry white wine",
            "2 teaspoons red pepper flakes",
            "1 handful fresh chive stems (about 40), halved",
            "1 cup loosely packed fresh basil, thinly sliced",
            "1/2 cup fresh oregano"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Brush 1 teaspoon oil onto each slice of bread. Toast until brown and crisp. Rub both sides (one side if using baguette) with whole garlic. Cut bread in half on the diagonal. Heat remaining 2 tablespoon oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook sliced garlic, scallions and salt, stirring occasionally, until scallions and garlic color slightly, about 5 minutes. Add mussels, tomato puree, wine and pepper flakes. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium, cover and cook until mussels open, 1 to 2 minutes. (Discard any mussels that don't open.) Uncover pan and add herbs; toss to combine. Divide mussels evenly among 4 bowls and spoon broth over them. Serve each with toast."
