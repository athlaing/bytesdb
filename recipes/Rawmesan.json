        "ingredients": [
            "2 cups raw pine nuts, soaked for 6 hours in filtered water and drained",
            "1 1/2 cups Rejuvelac",
            "1 tablespoon Celtic sea salt",
            "1 1/2 tablespoons large flake nutritional yeast"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "In a high-speed blender, combine the pine nuts and Rejuvelac and process until the mixture is thick and creamy. Pour into a small bowl, cover with a kitchen towel, and let stand in a warm place for 12 to 14 hours, or until the mixture smells like it has begun to ferment. It will have a yeasty odor. Stir in the salt and yeast, mixing carefully. Using an offset spatula, spread the pine nut mixture in a 1/8-inch-thick layer on nonstick drying sheets. Place on dehydrator shelves and dehydrate at 105\u00b0F for 10 to 14 hours, or until it breaks easily into dime-sized flakes. Use immediately, or transfer to a covered container and store in the refrigerator for up to several weeks.",
