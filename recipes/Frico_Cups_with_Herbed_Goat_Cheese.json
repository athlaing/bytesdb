            "Stir together parmesan and flour with a fork. Heat an 8- to 10-inch nonstick skillet over moderately low heat until hot. Sprinkle 2 teaspoons parmesan mixture into a 2 1/2-inch free-form round in skillet and cook until cheese is set, about 10 seconds. Loosen edge of frico with plastic spatula, then turn over and cook 5 seconds more. Immediately transfer frico to a muffin cup, lightly pressing it in, and remove from cup once crisp, about 30 seconds. Make more frico cups in same manner.",
