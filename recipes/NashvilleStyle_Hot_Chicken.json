            "4 cups all-purpose flour",
            "Vegetable oil (for frying; about 10 cups)",
            "6 tablespoons cayenne pepper",
            "2 tablespoons dark brown sugar",
            "1 teaspoon chili powder",

        "instructions": [
            "Toss chicken with black pepper and 2 tablespoon salt in a large bowl. Cover and chill at least 3 hours. Whisk eggs, buttermilk, and hot sauce in a large bowl. Whisk flour and remaining 4 teaspoons salt in another large bowl. Fit a Dutch oven with thermometer; pour in oil to measure 2\". Heat over medium-high heat until thermometer registers 325\u00b0. Pat chicken dry. Working with 1 piece at a time, dredge in flour mixture, shaking off excess, then dip in buttermilk mixture, letting excess drip back into bowl. Dredge again in flour mixture and place on a baking sheet. Working in 4 batches and returning oil to 325\u00b0 between batches, fry chicken, turning occasionally, until skin is deep golden brown and crisp and an instant-read thermometer inserted into thickest part of pieces registers 160\u00b0 for white meat and 165\u00b0 for dark, 15-18 minutes. Transfer to a clean wire rack set inside a baking sheet. Let oil cool slightly. Whisk cayenne, brown sugar, chili powder, garlic powder, and paprika in a medium bowl; carefully whisk in 1 cup frying oil. Brush fried chicken with spicy oil. Serve with bread and pickles. Do ahead: Chicken can be seasoned 1 day ahead. Keep chilled.",
