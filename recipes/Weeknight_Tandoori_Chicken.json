            "In a medium bowl, combine the garlic powder, coriander, cumin, ginger, salt, and cayenne with a fork. Dredge the chicken in the spice mixture and set aside. In a large skillet, heat the oil over medium heat. Add the chicken, sprinkle any remaining spices on top, and sear until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes on each side. Add the coconut milk and tomato sauce, bring to a boil, and cover with a lid. Reduce the heat to low and cook until the chicken is done all the way through (no longer pink), 8 to 10 minutes. Layer in bowls with brown rice on the bottom, then spinach, chicken, sauce, yogurt, and fresh herbs. Enjoy!",
