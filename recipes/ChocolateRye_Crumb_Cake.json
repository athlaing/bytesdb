Whisk all-purpose flour, rye flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a medium bowl. Using an electric mixer on mediumhigh speed, beat butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar in a medium bowl until light and fluffy, about 5 minutes. Scrape down sides of bowl and add eggs and vanilla; mix until blended, about 2 minutes. Reduce speed to low and add half of dry ingredients followed by buttermilk, mixing well after each addition. Repeat with remaining dry ingredients and yogurt (this is a stiffer batter). Scrape into prepared pan. Scatter crumble over.
