        "instructions": [
            "Cook rice and bay leaf in a large pot of boiling salted water until some grains have burst and rice is tender, 45\u201355 minutes. Drain thoroughly and spread out rice on a rimmed baking sheet to cool; discard bay leaf.",
            "Meanwhile, preheat oven to 350\u00b0F. Toast hazelnuts on a rimmed baking sheet, tossing halfway through, until slightly darkened and fragrant, 8\u201310 minutes. Let cool, then rub hazelnuts in a clean kitchen towel to remove some of the skins. Gently crush nuts by pressing under the flat side of a chef\u2019s knife; set aside.",
            "Heat butter in a large skillet over medium-low. Cook onion and garlic, stirring often, until onion is golden, 15\u201320 minutes. Remove from heat.",
            "Whisk vinegar, maple syrup, and mustard in a large bowl until smooth. Scrape in onion mixture and cooled rice and toss to coat; season with salt and pepper. Fold in nearly all of the hazelnuts and cress, then transfer to a platter. Top with remaining hazelnuts and cress.",
            "Do Ahead Rice can be cooked 2 days ahead. Let cool; cover and chill. Rice mixture (without hazelnuts and cress) can be made 3 hours ahead; store airtight at room temperature.",
