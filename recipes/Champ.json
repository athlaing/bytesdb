        "ingredients": [
            "6 to 8 unpeeled baking potatoes, e.g., Russet or Yukon Gold",
            "1 bunch scallions (use the bulb and green stem)",
            "1 1/2 cups milk",
            "4 to 8 tablespoons butter",

        "instructions": [
            "Scrub the potatoes and boil them in their jackets. Finely chop the scallions. Cover the scallions with cold milk and bring slowly to a boil. Simmer for about 3 to 4 minutes, then turn off the heat and leave to infuse. Peel and mash the freshly boiled potatoes and, while hot, mix with the boiling milk and scallions. Beat in some of the butter. Season to taste with salt and freshly ground pepper. Serve in one large or four individual bowls with a knob of butter melting in the center. Champ may be put aside and reheated later in a moderate oven at 350\u00b0F. Cover with foil while it reheats so that it doesn't get a skin.",
