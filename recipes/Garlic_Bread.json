Stir together butter, oil, and garlic paste in a bowl until combined well; stir in parsley. Halve loaf horizontally and divide butter mixture between halves, spreading it evenly. Divide cheese between halves and spread it in an even layer. Put halves, cheese side up, on a large baking sheet.

Broil bread until golden, 1-3 minutes.",
