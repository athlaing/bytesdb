            "4 large eggs",
            "1/2 Spanish onion, finely diced",
            "1 to 2 tablespoons/15 to 30 grams Schmaltz",
            "Kosher salt",
            "Freshly ground black pepper",
            "1/4 teaspoon cayenne",
            "1 tablespoon minced shallot macerated in a tablespoon of lemon juice for at least 5 minutes",
            "1 teaspoon fish sauce",
            "1 small celery stalk, diced",
            "2 tablespoons/15 grams gribenes"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "1. In a small saucepan, cover the eggs with 1 inch/3 centimeters of water and bring the water to a boil over high heat. As soon as the water reaches a full boil, cover the pan and take it off the heat. Let the eggs sit in the covered pan, off the heat, for 12 to 15 minutes, then remove them from the water. (Or, if you have a pressure cooker, steam them for 7 minutes, then chill; these are invariably easier to peel.) Run the eggs under cold water, or transfer them to an ice bath, till they're thoroughly chilled. Peel the eggs.",
            "2. Meanwhile, in a separate small saucepan over medium heat, saute half the onion in 1 teaspoon schmaltz till translucent. It's a good idea to give them a pinch of salt as you do this, don't be shy. Transfer the onions to a plate and allow to cool slightly.",
            "3. Combine all the ingredients except the celery and gribenes and do any of the following: put them through a meat grinder fitted with a medium or small die; coarsely chop them in a food processor; chop by hand and finish by mashing to a pleasing consistency with a fork. Then fold in the celery and the gribenes."
