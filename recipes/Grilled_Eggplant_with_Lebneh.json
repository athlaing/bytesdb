        "title": "Grilled Eggplant with Lebneh ",
        "ingredients": [
            "1/2 cup lebneh* (thick Middle Eastern\u2013style yogurt) or 1 cup whole-milk plain yogurt",
            "1 garlic clove",
            "1 teaspoon salt",
            "2 to 4 tablespoons water",
            "2 lb eggplant (2 medium), cut crosswise into 3/4-inch-thick slices",
            "1/2 cup olive oil",
            "Garnish: fresh mint leaves"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "If using whole-milk plain yogurt, drain in a paper-towel-lined sieve set over a bowl, covered and chilled, 8 to 12 hours.",
            "Mince garlic and mash to a paste with a pinch of salt, then transfer to a bowl. Whisk in lebneh or drained yogurt, 1/4 teaspoon salt, and enough water to make mixture resemble well-stirred sour cream.",
            "Prepare grill for cooking. If using a charcoal grill, open vents on bottom of grill, then light charcoal. Charcoal fire is medium-hot when you can hold your hand 5 inches above rack for 3 to 4 seconds. If using a gas grill, preheat burners on moderately high, covered, 10 minutes, then reduce heat to moderate.",
            "Brush eggplant slices generously with oil on both sides and sprinkle with remaining 3/4 teaspoon salt. Grill slices on lightly oiled grill rack, covered only if using a gas grill, turning over occasionally, until eggplant is tender, 12 to 15 minutes total. Transfer as cooked to a platter, arranging slices in 1 layer. Put a spoonful of yogurt mixture on each eggplant slice and top with a mint leaf."
