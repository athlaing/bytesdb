            "Cook cauliflower in large pot of boiling salted water until very tender, about 10 minutes. Drain and cool. Add garlic and half of cauliflower to processor; blend until smooth. Add remaining cauliflower, parsley, and dill. Pulse until cauliflower is chopped and mixture is still slightly chunky. Transfer to large bowl. Mix in breadcrumbs, baking powder, salt, Aleppo pepper, and black pepper. Beat 2 eggs in small bowl; mix into batter. If batter is dry, beat remaining 1 egg in same bowl to blend and mix into batter by tablespoonfuls until moist but not runny batter forms. DO AHEAD: Can be made 1 day ahead. Cover and chill. Add enough oil to heavy large skillet to coat bottom generously; heat over medium-high heat. Working in batches, drop 1 tablespoonful batter for each latke into skillet; flatten to 11/2-inch round. Cook until golden, adding oil as needed and adjusting heat if browning quickly, about 2 minutes per side. Transfer to rimmed baking sheets. DO AHEAD: Can be made 2 hours ahead. Let stand at room temperature. Preheat oven to 350\u00b0F. Bake latkes uncovered until heated through, about 10 minutes. Serve latkes with aioli, if desired, or sprinkle with za'atar and serve.",
