            "Preheat oven to 400\u00b0F with rack in upper third. Toss pecans with butter, sugar, and 1/2 teaspoon salt, then toast in a 4-sided sheet pan until fragrant and a shade darker, 8 to 10 minutes. Transfer to a plate and cool completely. Pulse pecans in a food processor just until finely chopped, then transfer to a wide shallow bowl. Stir together goat cheese, rosemary, coriander, and 1/2 teaspoon pepper until combined well. Form teaspoons of cheese mixture into marbles between your palms, then roll in pecans to coat and roll between your palms again briefly. Transfer to a plate. Put a parsley leaf under each cheese marble and spear together with a wooden pick.",
