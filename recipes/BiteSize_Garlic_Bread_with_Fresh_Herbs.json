        "ingredients": [
            "1 loaf miche or rustic sourdough bread, crust removed, cut into 1-inch cubes",
            "3 tablespoons white wine",
            "4 garlic cloves, very finely minced",
            "1 1/2 sticks (12 tablespoons) high-quality salted butter, at room temperature",
            "1 teaspoon red-pepper flakes",
            "1 teaspoon dried oregano",
            "3/4 teaspoon kosher salt",
            "2 tablespoons chopped flat-leaf parsley",
            "2 tablespoons chopped chives"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Preheat oven to 450\u00b0F. Spread cubed bread on a rimmed baking sheet. Toast until browned but still soft inside, 7 to 10 minutes.",
            "Meanwhile, place the white wine and garlic in a small pot. Bring to a simmer over medium heat and reduce the wine until almost all of the liquid has evaporated, 3 to 4 minutes. (Be careful not to reduce too much and scorch the wine and the garlic.) Scrape wine-garlic mixture into a medium bowl.",
            "Add the butter, red-pepper flakes, oregano, and salt to the bowl with the wine-garlic mixture. Use a wooden spoon to fully incorporate the ingredients into the butter. Leave at room temperature until serving.",
            "Spread a generous amount (about 3/4 teaspoon) of the flavored butter onto one side of each toast cube. Arrange toast cubes buttered side up on the rimmed baking sheet and return to oven until butter is melted, 3 to 5 minutes.",
            "Arrange the cubes on a serving platter and sprinkle with herbs. Serve immediately.",
            "The flavored butter can be made up to 3 days in advance and stored in the refrigerator."
