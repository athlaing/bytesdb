        "ingredients": [
            "3 pound Denver roast of venison, cut into 6- by 3-inch pieces",
            "2 heads garlic, cloves separated and smashed",
            "1/2 cup savory or thyme leaves, lightly crushed",
            "1/2 cup dry red wine",
            "1/4 teaspoon ground allspice",
            "1/2 teaspoon black peppercorns, slightly cracked",
            "1/4 cup plus 1 1/2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, divided",
            "1 tablespoon kosher salt"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Toss venison with garlic, savory, wine, allspice, peppercorns, and 1/4 cup oil in a sealable bag. Marinate, chilled, turning bag occasionally, at least 8 hours. Bring venison to room temperature, about 1 hour. Preheat oven to 450\u00b0F with rack in middle. Discard marinade and pat meat dry. Sprinkle on all sides with 1 tablespoon kosher salt, then 1/2 teaspoon ground pepper. Heat remaining 1 1/2 tablespoons oil in a 12-inch heavy skillet over medium-high heat until it shimmers, then brown meat on all sides in 2 or 3 batches, 3 to 4 minutes per batch. Transfer to a shallow baking pan. Roast until venison registers 125\u00b0F on an instant-read thermometer (inserted 2 inches horizontally into meat) for rare, 5 to 8 minutes (depending on thickness of meat). Let stand on a cutting board 10 minutes before slicing across the grain.",
