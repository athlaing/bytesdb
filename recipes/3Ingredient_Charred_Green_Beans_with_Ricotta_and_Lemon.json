            "1 1/2 pounds green beans, trimmed",
            "2 cups whole-milk ricotta",
            "3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for drizzling",
            "3/4 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more",

        "instructions": [
            "Prepare a grill for medium-high heat (or heat a grill pan over medium-high). If using a grill, arrange green beans in a grill basket and place on hot grill. Cover and grill, turning once halfway through, until beans are lightly charred and crisp-tender, about 8 minutes. If using a grill pan, cook green beans directly on pan, tossing occasionally, until lightly charred, about 10 minutes.",
            "Meanwhile, using an electric mixer on medium-high speed, whip ricotta, 3 Tbsp. oil, and 3/4 tsp. salt in a large bowl until smooth and fluffy, about 2 minutes.",
            "Spread whipped ricotta on a serving platter and arrange charred green beans over. Drizzle with oil and sprinkle with lemon zest; season with salt and pepper. Serve with lemon wedges alongside."
