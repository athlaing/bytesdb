            "1/2 pound fettuccine",
            "1 onion, chopped",
            "2 cups chopped Napa cabbage",
            "1 tablespoon vegetable oil",
            "1/4 pound cooked ham, chopped",
            "1/2 teaspoon caraway seeds",

        "instructions": [
            "In a large saucepan of salted boiling water cook the fettuccine until it is al dente, reserve 1/2 cup of the cooking water, and drain the pasta well. While the pasta is cooking, in a heavy skillet cook the onion and the cabbage in the oil over moderate heat, stirring, until the vegetables are golden, stir in the ham and the caraway seeds, and cook the mixture, stirring occasionally, for 2 minutes, or until the cabbage is tender. Add the cream and simmer the mixture for 1 minute. In a large bowl toss together the fettuccine, the ham mixture, and salt and pepper to taste and add enough of the reserved cooking water to thin the sauce to the desired consistency."
