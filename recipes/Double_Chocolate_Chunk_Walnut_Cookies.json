            "Cooking spray or oil mister (optional)",
            "1/2 cup raw sugar",
            "1/3 cup unpacked dark brown sugar",
            "1/4 cup mashed avocado",
            "1 tablespoon unsweetened applesauce",
            "1 large egg white",
            "1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract",
            "1/2 cup (65 grams) white whole wheat unbleached flour (I recommend King Arthur)",
            "1/3 cup (50 grams) all-purpose flour",
            "1/3 cup unsweetened cocoa powder (I use Trader Joe's)",
            "1/4 teaspoon baking soda",
            "1/8 teaspoon kosher salt",
            "1/3 cup semisweet chocolate chunks",
            "1/2 cup finely chopped walnuts"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Preheat the oven to 350\u00b0F. Line 2 regular baking sheets with silicone baking mats (such as Silpats) or lightly spray nonstick baking sheets with oil.",
            "In a large bowl, using an electric hand mixer, whisk together the sugars, avocado, applesauce, egg white, and vanilla until the sugar dissolves, about 2 to 3 minutes.",
            "In a separate large bowl, whisk together the flours, cocoa powder, baking soda, and salt. Fold in the dry ingredients with a spatula in two additions. Using a spatula, fold in the chocolate chunks and walnuts. The dough will be very sticky. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate 15 minutes.",
            "Drop the dough by tablespoonfuls about 1 inch apart onto the prepared baking sheets and smooth the tops.",
            "Bake until almost set, 10 to 12 minutes. Let cool for 5 minutes on the pan, then transfer to wire racks to cool completely."
