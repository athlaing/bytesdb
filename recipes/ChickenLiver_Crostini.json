            "1 medium red onion, finely chopped",
            "1/2 pound chicken livers, trimmed and patted dry",
            "1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon hot red-pepper flakes",
            "3 tablespoons capers, rinsed and coarsely chopped",
            "1/2 cup sweet (red) vermouth",

        "instructions": [
            "Heat butter and oil in a 12-inch heavy skillet over medium heat until foam subsides, then cook onion, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 3 minutes. Add livers and cook over medium-high heat until undersides are browned, about 3 minutes. Turn livers over and add red-pepper flakes, capers, and 1 teaspoon salt. Cook until livers are just cooked through, 5 to 7 minutes more. Increase heat to high and add vermouth. Boil, stirring, until slightly thickened and glossy, about 3 minutes. Transfer livers with a slotted spoon to a cutting board, then transfer sauce to a bowl. Coarsely chop livers and add to sauce. Season with salt and pepper and gently stir in parsley. Spoon onto toasts and squeeze a little lemon juice over each.",
