Brush phyllo sheet with butter and fold in half lengthwise. Brush folded surface with butter. Cut in half crosswise.

Place second phyllo rectangle in pie plate, covering bottom and letting pastry overhang another section of edge by 1/2 inch; brush with butter. Repeat process with remaining 4 phyllo sheets, making certain entire surface of edge is covered to form crust. Fold overhang under to form crust edge flush with edge of pie plate. Brush crust edges with butter. (Can be prepared 4 hours ahead. Cover and refrigerate.)",
