            "Butter eight 2/3-to 3/4-cup ramekins or custard cups; dust with sugar, completely coating to top edge. Whisk 1/2 cup sugar, flour, and 1/8 teaspoon (scant) salt in small saucepan. Pour 2/3 cup milk into measuring cup; whisk enough milk from cup into saucepan to form thick paste (2 to 3 tablespoons), then gradually whisk in remaining milk from cup. Stir over medium- low heat until bubbles begin to form around edges of pan. Continue cooking until slightly thickened, stirring constantly, about 2 minutes longer. Transfer mixture to large bowl. Add cocoa powder, remaining 2 tablespoons milk, egg yolks, and vanilla; stir until smooth, thick paste forms. Using electric mixer, beat egg whites and cream of tartar in medium bowl until soft peaks form. Gradually beat in remaining 3 tablespoons sugar, beating on high speed until firm peaks form. Add 1\u20444 of whites to chocolate mixture; fold to blend. Add remaining beaten egg whites and chopped chocolate and fold until whites are just blended into batter.",
            "Divide batter among prepared ramekins; place on rimmed baking sheet. DO AHEAD: Can be made 1 day ahead. Cover; chill.",
            "Position rack in bottom third of oven and preheat to 375\u00b0F. Bake souffl\u00e9s until puffed above rim of ramekin and toothpick inserted into center comes out with thick batter attached, about 12 minutes (15 minutes for chilled souffl\u00e9s). Using spoon, form small indentation in top of each souffl\u00e9; spoon dollop of Orange Blossom Cream into indentations. Serve immediately."
