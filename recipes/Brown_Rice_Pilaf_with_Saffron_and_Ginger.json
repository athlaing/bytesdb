        "ingredients": [
            "1 teaspoon warm water",
            "1/8 teaspoon saffron",
            "1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil",
            "1 tablespoon diced shallot",
            "1 cup brown basmati rice, soaked, rinsed, and drained well",
            "1 3/4 cups water or vegetable broth, homemade or store-bought",
            "1/2 teaspoon sea salt",
            "1 (1-inch) piece unpeeled fresh ginger",
            "1 tablespoon freshly squeezed lemon juice",
            "1 teaspoon lemon zest",
            "1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh parsley"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Combine the warm water and saffron in a small bowl. Heat the olive oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Add the shallot and saut\u00e9 until translucent, about 3 minutes. Add the rice and saffron and cook, stirring constantly, until the rice is evenly coated with the oil. Stir in the water, salt, and ginger. Increase the heat, cover, and bring to a boil. Decrease the heat to low and simmer for 20 to 25 minutes, until the water is absorbed. Check after 20 minutes; if there are steam holes on the top, it's ready. Remove ginger. Add the lemon juice, lemon zest, and parsley and fluff with a fork to combine."
