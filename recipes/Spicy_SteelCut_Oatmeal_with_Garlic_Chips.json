        "ingredients": [
            "1/2 cup (125 g) raw steel-cut oats",
            "2 tablespoons olive oil",
            "4 cloves garlic, very thinly sliced",
            "About 1 tablespoon tamari",
            "Chinese chile paste (sambal oelek) to taste",
            "2 scallions, thinly sliced on a bias",
            "2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro"

        "instructions": [
            "In a heavy 1 1/2- to 2-quart (1.4- to 2-L) saucepan, combine the oats and 2 cups (480 ml) water. Bring to a boil, then lower the heat and simmer, stirring occasionally, until creamy and tender, about 25 minutes. Meanwhile, in a small saut\u00e9 pan, heat the oil over medium high heat and add the garlic, tilting the pan so the oil is deeper at the edge and the garlic floats as it fries. Fry, stirring, until crisp and golden, about 1 minute. Remove the garlic to a paper towel to drain. Spoon the oatmeal into two small bowls. Drizzle with tamari and dollop with chile paste. Sprinkle the scallions, cilantro, and garlic chips over the top and serve.",
