            "4 6-ounce beef tenderloin steaks (each about 1 inch thick)",
            "2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil",
            "3 bay leaves (2 finely crushed, 1 whole)",
            "1/2 cup brine-cured olives (such as Kalamata)",

            "Bring small saucepan of water to boil over medium-high heat. Add olives and return water to boil. Drain olives.",
            "Scrape most of bay leaves off steaks; sprinkle steaks with salt and pepper. Heat remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat. Add steaks and saut\u00e9 to desired doneness, about 4 minutes per side for medium-rare. Transfer steaks to plate. Add white wine to skillet and bring to boil, scraping up browned bits. Add tomato puree, whole bay leaf, and drained olives to skillet. Cook until sauce is slightly thickened, stirring frequently, about 5 minutes.
