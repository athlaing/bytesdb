            "Combine water, ground coffee, and sugar in small saucepan or Turkish coffeepot. Stir over low heat until sugar dissolves; bring just to simmer (coffee will foam and rise to top edge of pan). Divide half of coffee among 6 small cups, pouring slowly to avoid breaking foam on top. Return pan to low heat and let mixture foam again to top edge of pan. Carefully pour remaining coffee into cups, leaving grounds in saucepan. Serve immediately.",
