            "Cover pork belly with brine in a large heavy roasting pan, then chill 24 hours.",
            "Remove pork belly from brine, discarding brine, and rinse under cold water. Pat pork belly dry. Wash and dry roasting pan.",
            "Braise pork belly: Preheat oven to 225\u00b0F with rack in middle. Straddle roasting pan across 2 burners and heat oil over medium-high heat until it shimmers, then cook onion, garlic, and shallots, stirring occasionally, until golden, about 5 minutes. Add stock and bring to a boil, scraping up brown bits. Add pork belly and remove from heat. Cover roasting pan tightly with foil and braise in oven until pork belly is very tender, 3 1/2 to 4 1/2 hours.

When charcoal turns grayish white, the grill will be at its hottest and will then begin to cool off. Grill is ready when you can hold your hand 5 inches above grill rack directly over coals for just 3 to 4 seconds (medium-hot). If using a gas grill, preheat all burners on high 10 minutes, then adjust heat to medium-high.",
