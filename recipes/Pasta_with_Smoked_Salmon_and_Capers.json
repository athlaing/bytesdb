        "ingredients": [
            "1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil",
            "1 small onion, chopped",
            "1/4 pound smoked salmon, chopped",
            "1 cup heavy cream (a.k.a. whipping cream)",
            "3 tablespoons capers, drained",
            "Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste",
            "N/A freshly ground black pepper",
            "1 pound pasta, cooked al dente, drained (reserving about 1/4 cup of the cooking water), and tossed with olive oil",
            "N/A olive oil",
            "Freshly grated imported Parmesan cheese"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over medium-high heat. Add the onion and saut\u00e9 until translucent, but not browned. Add the smoked salmon and continue cooking just until the salmon turns opaque, 1 to 2 minutes. Pour in the cream and add the capers. Taste and adjust seasoning with salt and pepper. Be careful how much salt you add because the smoked salmon and capers are both salty. Add the pasta and toss to coat. If there doesn't appear to be enough sauce, add a couple of tablespoons of the pasta cooking water to thin it down. Serve with freshly grated Parmesan cheese."
