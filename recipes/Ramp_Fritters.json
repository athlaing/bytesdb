            "1 cup all-purpose flour",
            "3/4 cup rice flour",
            "1 tsp. baking powder",
            "1 tsp. sugar",
            "1 tsp. kosher salt",
            "3/4 cup club soda",
            "3/4 cup light beer",
            "10 oz. ramps, trimmed, cut into 1\" pieces (about 5 cups)",
            "Vegetable oil (for frying; about 6 cups)",
            "Lemon wedges (for serving)",
            "A deep-fry thermometer"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Remove any slippery outer layers from ramp bulbs, trim roots, then soak in a bowl of cold water, swishing around gently to loosen any dirt.",
            "Lift out ramps and blot dry with paper towels. Avoid cramming them in a salad spinner so as not to damage the delicate leaves.",
            "Cut ramps into 1\" pieces ( you should get about 5 cups). Whisk all-purpose flour, rice flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt in a large bowl to combine. Make a well in the center and pour in club soda and beer; whisk until smooth. Fold in ramps.",
            "Pour oil into a large cast-iron skillet fitted with thermometer to come 1\" up sides and heat over medium-high until thermometer registers 350\u00b0F. Working in batches, place 1/4-cup mounds of batter into skillet and press down lightly to flatten and submerge. Fry, turning once, until fritters are golden brown, about 4 minutes. Transfer to paper towels to drain; sprinkle with salt. Serve with lemon wedges for squeezing over."
