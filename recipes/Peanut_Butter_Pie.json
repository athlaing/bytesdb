        "ingredients": [
            "1 1/4 cups graham cracker crumbs",
            "3 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted",
            "1 cup heavy cream",
            "8 ounces cream cheese, at room temperature",
            "1 1/4 cups creamy peanut butter",
            "3/4 cup packed light brown sugar",
            "2 tablespoons pure vanilla extract"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Preheat the oven to 350\u00b0F.",
            "In a bowl, stir together the graham cracker crumbs and melted butter; press into the bottom and sides of a 9-inch pie dish. Bake until brown, about 5 minutes. Set aside to cool completely.",
            "With a heavy-duty stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, whisk the cream at high speed until it forms stiff peaks. Transfer to a large clean bowl and set aside.",
            "Fit the stand mixer with the paddle attachment and a clean bowl; add the cream cheese, peanut butter, brown sugar, and vanilla and beat at high speed until the mixture is smooth and silky.",
            "Gently fold the cream cheese-peanut butter mixture into the whipped cream with a spatula until completely blended. Spoon into the cooled pie shell and smooth out the top. Place the pie in the freezer for 1 hour or until ready to serve (if you are going to leave it in the freezer awhile, wrap it in plastic wrap after 1 hour so it doesn't get freezer burn).",
            "Take the pie out of the freezer 15 minutes before serving. Slice it and pig out!"
