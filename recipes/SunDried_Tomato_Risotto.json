        "title": "Sun-Dried Tomato Risotto ",
        "ingredients": [
            "1 ounce sun-dried tomatoes (not packed in oil, about 10)",
            "1 cup water",
            "2 1/2 cups chicken broth",
            "1 cup finely chopped onion",
            "1 garlic clove, minced",
            "4 tablespoons olive oil",
            "1 cup Arborio rice (available at specialty foods shops and some supermarkets)",
            "1/4 cup freshly grated Parmesan",
            "finely chopped fresh parsley leaves for sprinkling the risotto if desired"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "In a small saucepan simmer the tomatoes in the water for 1 minute, drain them, reserving the liquid, and chop them. In a saucepan combine the reserved cooking liquid and the broth, bring the liquid to a simmer, and keep it at a bare simmer. In a large saucepan cook the onion and the garlic in the oil over moderately low heat, stirring, until they are softened, add the rice, stirring until each grain is coated with oil, and stir in the tomatoes. Add 1/2 cup of the simmering liquid and cook the mixture over moderate heat, stirring constantly, until the liquid is absorbed. Continue adding the liquid, 1/2 cup at a time, stirring constantly and letting each portion be absorbed before adding the next, until the rice is tender but still al dente. (The rice should take about 17 minutes to become al dente.) Stir in the Parmesan and salt and pepper to taste and sprinkle the risotto with the parsley."
