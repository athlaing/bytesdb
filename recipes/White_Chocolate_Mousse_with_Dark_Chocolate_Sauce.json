            "8 ounces imported white chocolate (such as Lindt), chopped",
            "1 cup plus 6 tablespoons chilled whipping cream",

            "Stir white chocolate, 1/4 cup cream and 2 tablespoons syrup in heavy small saucepan over low heat until chocolate is melted and smooth. Pour into medium bowl; cool to barely lukewarm. Using electric mixer, beat 3/4 cup cream in medium bowl to medium-firm peaks. Fold cream into white chocolate mixture in 2 batches. Divide mousse among 4 custard cups. Cover and refrigerate until firm, about 4 hours. (Can be prepared 2 days ahead.) Bring remaining 6 tablespoons cream and remaining 2 tablespoons corn syrup to simmer in heavy small saucepan over high heat. Reduce heat to low; add bittersweet chocolate and stir until melted and smooth. Cool to room temperature. Spoon enough sauce over each mousse to cover completely. Garnish with mint, if desired.",
