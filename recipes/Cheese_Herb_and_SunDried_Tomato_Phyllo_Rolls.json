        "ingredients": [
            "1 large egg",
            "3/4 cup (packed) grated aged kefalotyri cheese (3 ounces)",
            "3/4 cup (packed) grated kasseri cheese (3 ounces)",
            "1/4 cup (packed) finely crumbled feta cheese (3 ounces)",
            "2 tablespoons finely chopped drained oil-packed sun-dried tomatoes",
            "2 teaspoons fresh thyme leaves",
            "1 teaspoon chopped fresh marjoram",
            "1/4 teaspoon ground white or black pepper",
            "8 sheets phyllo pastry (about 12x14 inches), thawed if frozen",
            "Extra-virgin olive oil"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Whisk egg in medium bowl until frothy. Mix in all cheeses, tomatoes, thyme, marjoram, and pepper. Cover and chill until ready to use, up to 1 day.",
            "Stack phyllo sheets. Using sharp knife or shears, cut sheets in half lengthwise, making sixteen 5- to 6-inch-wide pastry strips. Place 1 strip on work surface (keep remaining strips covered with plastic wrap and damp towel to prevent drying). Brush entire strip with oil. Place 1 heaping tablespoon cheese filling in center of strip, 1 inch in from 1 short pastry edge. Shape filling into 3-inch-long log, parallel to short edge. Fold short edge, then sides of pastry, over filling. Continue to roll up, enclosing filling completely. Brush all over with oil; place on rimmed baking sheet. Repeat with remaining phyllo strips and filling. Can be made 1 day ahead. Cover and refrigerate.",
            "Preheat oven to 350\u00b0F. Bake rolls uncovered until filling is heated through and pastry is golden, about 18 minutes. Transfer to platter; serve hot."
