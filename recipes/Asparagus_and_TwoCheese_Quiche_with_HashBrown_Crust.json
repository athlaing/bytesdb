Add potatoes and immediately start forming into a crust by pushing potatoes flat against bottom and sides of pan with a 1/2-cup dry measuring cup. Continue cooking, pressing potatoes up sides of pan if they start shrinking, until potatoes are bound together and bottom of crust is starting to brown, about 10 minutes. Remove pan from heat and set aside.",

            "Sprinkle Fontina cheese, goat cheese, and saut\u00e9ed shallots evenly over bottom of crust, then pour in egg mixture. Arrange asparagus decoratively on top. Bake until quiche is set and crust is well browned, 30-35 minutes. Let cool to room temperature before cutting into wedges and serving from the pan."
