        "ingredients": [
            "1 lb frozen or fresh edamame (soybeans) in the pod or 2 1/2 lb fresh fava beans in the pod, shelled",
            "3 lb small boiling potatoes (preferably purple or red fingerling)",
            "3 lb haricots verts (thin French green beans) or thin regular green beans",
            "1/4 cup minced shallot",
            "1/4 cup chopped fresh mint",
            "1/4 to 1/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Have ready a large bowl of ice and cold water. Boil edamame or fava beans in a large pot of boiling salted water until crisp-tender, 1 to 3 minutes. Transfer with a slotted spoon to ice water. Shell edamame, or peel tough outer skins from fava beans.",
            "Bring potatoes and enough salted water to cover by 1 1/2 inches to a boil and cook at a bare simmer until almost tender, 15 to 20 minutes. (Potatoes will continue to cook a bit after being removed from water. Be careful not to overcook or potatoes will break apart when sliced.) Transfer with a slotted spoon to ice water to cool. Drain well.",
            "While potatoes are cooking, trim haricots verts and halve diagonally crosswise. Cook in 2 batches in a large pot of boiling salted water until just tender, 3 to 4 minutes (regular green beans will take longer to cook). Transfer to ice water to cool. Drain well.",
            "Just before serving, cut potatoes into 1/3-inch-thick slices and toss all ingredients together in a large bowl with salt and pepper to taste."
