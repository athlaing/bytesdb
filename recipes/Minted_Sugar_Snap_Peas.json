            "In a kettle of salted boiling water cook the snap peas for 1 to 3 minutes, or until they are crisp-tender, drain them, and plunge them into a bowl of ice and cold water to stop the cooking. Drain the peas well. In a large skillet melt the butter, add 1 tablespoon of the mint, the peas, and salt and pepper to taste, and heat the mixture over moderately low heat, stirring, until the peas are heated through. Sprinkle the peas with the remaining 1 tablespoon mint."
