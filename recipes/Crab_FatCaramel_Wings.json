            "1/2 cup fish sauce",
            "1 1/2 cups sugar",
            "1/4 cup Thai crab or shrimp paste with bean oil",
            "Peanut or vegetable oil (for frying; about 10 cups)",
            "1 cup all-purpose flour",
            "1 teaspoon baking powder",
            "1 1/2 cups cornstarch, divided",
            "1/2 cup vodka",
            "2 pounds chicken wings, tips removed, flats and drumettes separated",
            "Kosher salt",
            "Freshly ground pepper",
            "1/4 cup chopped salted, roasted peanuts",
            "Fresh cilantro leaves with tender stems (for serving)",
            "A deep-fry thermometer"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Bring fish sauce to a boil in a medium saucepan and cook until reduced almost by half (it will darken and become pungent), about 5 minutes. Stir in sugar and fit saucepan with thermometer. Cook until thermometer registers 230\u00b0F (mixture will become thick and dark). Whisk in crab paste and 1 tablespoons water until smooth. Reduce heat to low; keep warm until ready to dip wings.",
            "Fit a large pot with clean thermometer and pour in oil to measure 2\". Heat over medium-high heat until thermometer registers 350\u00b0F.",
            "Meanwhile, whisk flour, baking powder, and 1 cup cornstarch in a medium bowl. Whisking constantly, gradually add vodka and 1 3/4 cups water, adding more water if batter is too thick (it should be slightly thinner than cream but thicker than milk).",
            "Place remaining 1/2 cup cornstarch in a shallow dish. Season chicken with salt and pepper and dredge in cornstarch, shaking off excess.",
            "Working in 3 batches and returning oil to 350\u00b0F between batches, coat chicken in batter, letting excess drip back into bowl, and fry until skin is golden and chicken is crisp and cooked through, about 5 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack set inside a baking sheet to drain. Using tongs, add hot wings to warm caramel, turn to coat, then transfer wings to a platter. Serve wings topped with peanuts and cilantro.",
            "Do ahead: Caramel sauce can be made 3 days ahead. Keep airtight at room temperature. Reheat before using.",
