        "ingredients": [
            "8 8-ounce red-skinned sweet potatoes (yams), scrubbed",
            "1 cup dried cranberries",
            "4 tablespoons (1/2 stick) butter",
            "2 large firm but ripe pears, peeled, cored, cut into 1/2-inch cubes",
            "1 cup pecans, coarsely chopped",
            "4 teaspoons minced peeled fresh ginger",
            "4 teaspoons (packed) golden brown sugar",

        "instructions": [
            "Position rack in center of oven and preheat to 350\u00b0F. Line baking sheet with foil. Pierce potatoes in several places with fork; place on prepared baking sheet. Bake until potatoes are tender when pierced with fork, about 55 minutes. Cool slightly.",
            "Meanwhile, place cranberries in small bowl; pour enough hot water over to cover. Let stand 5 minutes to soften. Drain well. Melt 2 tablespoons butter in large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add pears and saut\u00e9 until tender and golden, about 4 minutes. Stir in cranberries, pecans, ginger, and brown sugar; saut\u00e9 1 minute. Mix in 2 teaspoons vinegar and 1/2 teaspoon salt.",
            "Cut off top 1/4 of each potato lengthwise; discard tops. Using fork, gently mash pulp inside each potato. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Melt remaining 2 tablespoons butter in small saucepan over low heat. Whisk in remaining 1 1/2 tablespoons vinegar. Drizzle about 1 teaspoon butter-vinegar mixture into each potato; mix with fork to blend.",
            "Mound cranberry mixture in sweet potatoes. (Can be prepared 4 hours ahead. Cover loosely with plastic wrap; let stand at room temperature. Rewarm sweet potatoes uncovered in 350\u00b0F oven until heated through, about 20 minutes.)"
