            "2 cups water",
            "2 cups sugar",
            "1 3/4 teaspoons cayenne pepper",

            "Combine 2 cups water, sugar, and cayenne in heavy medium saucepan. Bring to boil over high heat, stirring until sugar dissolves and occasionally brushing down sides of pan with pastry brush dipped into water. Add walnuts to pan; reduce heat to medium and cook until syrup boils and bubbles thickly and vigorously and nuts are very sticky, about 35 minutes.",
            "Meanwhile, pour enough vegetable oil into heavy large saucepan to reach depth of 4 inches; heat vegetable oil to 350\u00b0F. Drain walnuts, discarding syrup. Working in batches and using slotted spoon, transfer walnuts to hot oil and cook until well browned, stirring constantly, about 2 minutes per batch. Using slotted spoon, transfer walnuts to rimmed baking sheet. Sprinkle with coarse salt; cool completely. (Can be made 3 days ahead. Store in airtight container at room temperature.)"
