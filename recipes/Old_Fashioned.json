            "1 scant teaspoon simple syrup",
            "2 dashes Angostura Bitters, plus more to taste",
            "1 half dollar\u2013sized slice orange peel, including pith",
            "2 ounces good-quality rye or bourbon",
            "1 maraschino cherry"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "In old-fashioned glass, combine simple syrup and bitters. Fill glass halfway with ice, then stir about a dozen times. Add enough ice to fill glass. Squeeze orange peel over glass to extract oils, add peel to glass, and add whiskey. Stir just until drink is cold and alcoholic bite has softened, about a dozen times. Garnish with cherry, swizzle stick, and straw."
