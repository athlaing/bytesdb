            "1 1/2 cups plus 2 tablespoons hoisin sauce",
            "1 cup oyster sauce",
            "1/4 cup black bean garlic sauce",
            "3 garlic cloves, chopped",
            "1 tablespoon chopped peeled fresh ginger",

        "instructions": [
            "Mix first 6 ingredients in large bowl for marinade. Place chops in extra-large resealable plastic bag. Add marinade to bag. Seal top, releasing excess air. Turn bag to coat chops. Refrigerate 3 to 5 days, turning bag occasionally.",
            "Preheat broiler, adjusting rack 8 inches below heat source. Line rimmed baking sheet with heavy-duty foil. Remove chops from marinade. Place chops on prepared pan with some marinade still clinging. Broil until chops are cooked through and thermometer inserted horizontally into center registers 145\u00b0F, watching closely to prevent burning (chops may char slightly in spots), about 9 minutes per side. Transfer to plates and serve."
