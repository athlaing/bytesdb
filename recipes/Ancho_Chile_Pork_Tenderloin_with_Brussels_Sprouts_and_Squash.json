            "Place racks in top and center of oven; preheat to 425\u00b0F. Finely grate 2 tsp. lime zest into a small bowl. Stir in cumin, chile powder, brown sugar, and 2 tsp. salt. Toss brussels sprouts, onion, squash, 2 Tbsp. oil, and half of spiced salt on a rimmed baking sheet. Transfer to center rack in oven and roast 10 minutes. Toss and continue to roast until vegetables are browned and cooked through, 10\u201315 minutes more. Meanwhile, rub pork tenderloins with remaining spiced salt and heat remaining 2 Tbsp. oil in a large skillet over medium-high. Sear pork on 3 sides until lightly browned, about 3 minutes per side. Turn tenderloins onto remaining side, then transfer skillet to top rack of oven. Roast pork until an instant-read thermometer inserted into thickest part registers 140\u00b0F for medium-rare or 145\u00b0F for medium, 8\u201310 minutes (temperature will rise by about 10\u00b0F after cooking). Transfer pork to a cutting board and let rest 5 minutes before slicing. Whisk sour cream, 2 tsp. lime juice, 1/2 cup cilantro, and remaining 1/4 tsp. salt in a small bowl. Spoon some sauce onto plates, then arrange pork over. Top with cilantro leaves, flakey sea salt, and pepper. Serve vegetables and lime wedges alongside.",
