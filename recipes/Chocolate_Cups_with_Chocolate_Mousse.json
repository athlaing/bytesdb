            "For mousse: Melt chocolate in top of double boiler over simmering water, stirring until smooth. Cool briefly. Meanwhile, combine water, yolks and powdered sugar in large metal bowl. Set bowl over simmering water in base of double boiler and whisk until mixture is frothy and candy thermometer registers 160\u00b0F, about 6 minutes. Remove from over water. Using electric mixer, beat until thick and cool, about 3 minutes. Fold cooled chocolate, then ground hazelnuts and Frangelico into yolk mixture. Beat cream in medium bowl until stiff peaks form. Fold into chocolate mixture in 3 additions. Peel paper liner from each chocolate cup. Arrange cups on platter. Pipe mousse into cups, dividing equally. Sprinkle chopped hazelnuts over. Serve immediately or chill up to 1 day.",
