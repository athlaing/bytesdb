            "1/4 cup (2 ounces) cherry ale",
            "Orange juice (200g is approximately 3/4 cup, but measurement is very precise in molecular gastronomy)",
            "Versa-Whip* (a very precise scale is needed to weigh ingredients in fractions of grams, I dont think it makes sense to give volume measurements)",

        "instructions": [
