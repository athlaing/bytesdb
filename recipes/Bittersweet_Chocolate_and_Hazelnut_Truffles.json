            "Place chocolate in medium metal bowl. Bring cream to simmer in small saucepan. Pour over chocolate; let stand 2 minutes. Whisk until smooth. Mix in brandy and vanilla.

Cover and refrigerate truffle mixture until firm, about 2 hours. Line baking sheet with waxed paper. Place 1 1/2 cups chopped nuts in another medium bowl. Fill glass with hot water. Dip 1-inch-diameter melon baller into water, then into truffle mixture, forming round truffle. Drop truffle into nuts; roll to coat completely and press to adhere. Place on prepared sheet.
