            "8 green onions, chopped (about 2 cups)",

        "instructions": [
            "Pour 2 tablespoons lemon juice into large bowl of water. Cut stem from 1 artichoke; pull off and discard 3 outer bottom layers of leaves, exposing pale green base. Carefully trim artichoke base and leaf ends. Cut artichoke in half. Using small spoon, remove choke and prickly leaves from center. Rub cut edges of artichoke with cut side of lemon half. Place artichoke in bowl of water and lemon juice. Repeat trimming of remaining artichokes, placing each in water with lemon juice. Heat oil in large Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add green onions; saut\u00e9 until tender, about 3 minutes. Add 3 cups water, dill, sugar, salt and 1/4 cup lemon juice. Bring to simmer. Drain artichokes; add to Dutch oven. Cover, simmer until artichoke bottoms are tender and leaves can be pulled off easily, occasionally pushing artichokes under water, about 30 minutes. Using slotted spoon, transfer artichokes to platter; reserve cooking liquid. Test artichokes with foil to keep warm, if desired. Place flour in small bowl. Whisk in 1/2 cup cooking liquid. Pour flour mixture into liquid in Dutch oven; bring to boil, stirring. Cook until sauce thickens, stirring constantly and thinning with more water if necessary, about 2 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Pour over artichokes. Serve warm or at room temperature.",
