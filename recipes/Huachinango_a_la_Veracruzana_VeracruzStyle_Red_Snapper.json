Add the garlic and saut\u00e9 briefly, then add the tomatoes and more salt. Cover and cook until the tomatoes change color. Lower the heat and add the olives, capers, raisins, jalape\u00f1os, and bay leaves. Cover and simmer until the sauce thickens, about 10 to 15 minutes.

Pour the remaining sauce over the fish then scatter the potato slices on top. Cover and bake until the fish flakes when tested with a fork, about 45 minutes. Garnish with the parsley and serve with the Arroz Blanco."
