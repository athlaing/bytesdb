            "1 ripe apricot, halved and pitted",
            "4 tablespoons regular plain or Greek yogurt",
            "Honey (try wildflower or lavender)",
            "1 tablespoon unsalted roasted pistachios, roughly chopped"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "1. Top each apricot half with 2 tablespoons of the yogurt, drizzle with the honey, sprinkle with the pistachios, and serve. 2. While it's not necessary, if you want to give your plain (i.e., non-Greek) yogurt a thicker consistency, line a sieve with a paper coffee filter and set it over a bowl. Empty an 8-ounce container into the sieve, cover it loosely with plastic wrap, and place it in the refrigerator for at least 6 hours.",
