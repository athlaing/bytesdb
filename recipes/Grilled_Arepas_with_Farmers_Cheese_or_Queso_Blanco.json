        "ingredients": [
            "1 cup corn kernels, fresh or frozen and thawed",
            "3/4 cup heated chicken stock or water",
            "1 cup instant cornmeal",
            "1 1/2 teaspoons sugar",
            "1 teaspoon sour cream",
            "1 ounce Manchego cheese, grated",
            "1 tablespoon butter, melted",
            "1/2 cup farmer's cheese or Mexican queso blanco"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "In a blender, process the corn kernels and chicken stock until smooth. Pour the cornmeal into a large bowl. Stir in the sugar and sour cream. Pour in the chicken stock and corn mixture while stirring with your hands or a wooden spoon. Add the grated cheese. Form mixture into a ball. Then separate into 8 pieces. Roll each piece into a ball and then flatten into a pancake about 1/4-inch thick and 2 inches in diameter (but rub your fingers around the edge so that it maintains its thickness). At this point you can cover the arepas with a damp kitchen towel and refrigerate them for up to 1 day before grilling.",
            "Light a fire in a charcoal or gas grill. Brush the arepas lightly with the melted butter (for flavor and to prevent sticking). Grill the arepas until golden, about 3 minutes on each side. They should be toasted on the outside, but soft in the middle. Let cool to room temperature. Before serving, top with a spread of the farmer's cheese."
