            "Heat butter and olive oil in a 4-to 5-quart pot over medium-low heat until foam subsides. Cook onion, chopped garlic, jalape\u00f1o, and raisins, covered, stirring occasionally, until onion begins to brown, 7 to 9 minutes.",
            "Add bourbon (use caution; alcohol may ignite) and boil, scraping up any brown bits, until most of liquid has evaporated, about 2 minutes. Stir in coffee, then boil until most of liquid has evaporated, 3 to 5 minutes. Repeat with cola.",
            "Add ketchup, soy sauce, vinegar, molasses, Worcestershire sauce, black bean paste, and chocolate and simmer, stirring occasionally, 5 minutes.",
            "Add spices and 1 teaspoon pepper and simmer over low heat, stirring occasionally, until very thick, about 10 minutes.",
            "Remove from heat and cool 15 minutes. Pur\u00e9e sauce in a blender with remaining 2 garlic cloves, lime juice, and sesame oil until smooth and thick.",
            "Cook pork chops: Rub 6 tablespoons sauce all over pork chops and marinate, chilled, in a large shallow baking dish at least 1 hour. Preheat oven to 350\u00b0F with rack in middle. Rub off excess marinade from chops with a paper towel. Heat oil in a 12-inch heavy skillet over medium-high heat until it shimmers, then brown chops in 2 batches, turning once, about 2 minutes total. Transfer to a 4-sided sheet pan (reserve skillet) and roast chops in oven until an instant-read thermometer inserted into center of chops registers 148 to 150\u00baF for juicy pink meat, 20 to 25 minutes. Transfer to a cutting board and let rest while cooking carrots.",
