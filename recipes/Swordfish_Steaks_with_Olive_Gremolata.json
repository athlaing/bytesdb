            "Prepare grill for medium-high heat; oil grate. Toss breadcrumbs with 1 Tbsp. oil in a medium bowl; season with salt and pepper. Place a cast-iron skillet directly on grill grate and toast breadcrumbs in skillet, tossing occasionally, until golden brown and crisp, about 5 minutes. Transfer toasted breadcrumbs back to bowl and let cool.",
