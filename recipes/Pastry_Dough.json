        "ingredients": [
            "2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour",
            "1 1/2 sticks (3/4 cup) cold unsalted butter, cut into 1/2-inch cubes",
            "1/4 cup cold vegetable shortening",
            "1/2 teaspoon salt",
            "4 to 6 tablespoons ice water",
            "a pastry or bench scraper"

        "instructions": [
            "Blend together flour, butter, shortening, and salt in a bowl with your fingertips or a pastry blender (or pulse in a food processor) until most of mixture resembles coarse meal with some small (roughly pea-size) butter lumps. Drizzle evenly with 4 tablespoons ice water and gently stir with a fork (or pulse in food processor) until incorporated. Squeeze a small handful: If it doesn't hold together, add more ice water, 1 tablespoon at a time, stirring (or pulsing) until incorporated, then test again. (Do not overwork mixture, or pastry will be tough.) Turn out mixture onto a lightly floured surface and divide into 8 portions. With heel of your hand, smear each portion once or twice in a forward motion to help distribute fat. Gather dough together with scraper and press into 2 balls, then flatten each into a 5-inch disk. Wrap disks separately in plastic wrap and chill until firm, at least 1 hour.",
