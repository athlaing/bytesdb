            "For breadcrumbs and radicchio: Preheat oven to 350\u00b0F. Line rimmed baking sheet with foil. Mix 1 tablespoon olive oil and garlic in medium bowl. Add bread cubes, oregano, and crushed red pepper; sprinkle with salt and pepper. Transfer bread cubes to prepared baking sheet. Bake bread cubes until golden brown, tossing occasionally, about 20 minutes. Cool. Transfer to work surface. Cover with paper towels. Using mallet or rolling pin, crush bread cubes into breadcrumbs. Preheat broiler. Line same baking sheet with fresh sheet of foil. Place radicchio wedges in large bowl. Drizzle remaining 3 tablespoons oil over; sprinkle with salt and pepper and toss to coat. Arrange wedges on prepared sheet. Broil until beginning to brown, about 3 minutes. Using tongs, turn radicchio over, fanning leaves out slightly. Broil until radicchio is soft and beginning to brown with some edges beginning to char, watching carefully to prevent burning, about 2 minutes longer. Return radicchio to same large bowl. Drizzle enough dressing over to coat; toss. Arrange wedges on plates. Sprinkle breadcrumbs over. Top with cheese shavings, arrange a few preserved lemon peel strips over, and serve.",
