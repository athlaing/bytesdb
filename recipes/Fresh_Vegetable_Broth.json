            "8 white mushrooms, halved",
            "2 carrots, unpeeled and cut into large chunks",
            "2 leeks, trimmed and cut into large chunks",
            "2 medium-sized tomatoes, quartered",
            "4 medium-sized new red potatoes, halved",
            "8 fresh parsley sprigs",
            "2 fresh dill sprigs",

        "instructions": [
            "1. Place water in a large, heavy pot. Rinse all the vegetables well, then add to pot. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat and simmer, uncovered, for 1 hour. Adjust the seasonings to taste and simmer for 30 minutes longer.",
            "2. Strain the broth; discard the bay leaf but reserve the vegetables to eat as is, or pur e them and use to thicken soups or sauces for stews. Let the broth cool to room temperature and then refrigerate, covered, in a storage container or freeze. Refrigerated, it will keep about 4 days. This recipe is easily doubled, and you will need more than 4 cups of broth for three of our soups."
