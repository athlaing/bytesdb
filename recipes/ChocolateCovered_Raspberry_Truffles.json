        "ingredients": [
            "1/4 cup heavy cream",
            "7 oz fine-quality bittersweet chocolate (not extra-bitter or unsweetened), finely chopped in a food processor",
            "1 1/2 tablespoons framboise (raspberry eau-de-vie) or brandy",
            "6 oz fresh raspberries (1 cup)",
            "3/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder",
            "a large sealable plastic bag"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Line a tray with wax paper.",
            "Bring cream just to a simmer in a 1- to 2-quart heavy saucepan over moderate heat. Remove from heat, then add chocolate and stir gently with a heatproof rubber spatula until ganache is smooth. Stir in framboise.",
            "Pat raspberries dry if necessary. Add 6 to 8 raspberries to ganache and gently fold in to coat using rubber spatula. Remove each chocolate-covered raspberry with 2 forks, shifting it from one fork to the other to let excess ganache drip off, then transfer to tray. Coat remaining raspberries in same manner, working in batches of 6 to 8.",
            "Chill truffles on tray until firm, at least 1 hour, then loosen from wax paper.",
            "Put cocoa in a sealable bag and add all of truffles. Seal bag, leaving some air in, and shake to coat. Empty bag into a shallow bowl. Transfer coated truffles to a platter with your fingers, shaking off excess cocoa. Keep chilled until ready to serve."
