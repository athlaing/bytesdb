        "instructions": [
            "Preheat the oven to 350\u00b0F. Grease a 10-inch cast-iron pan or other oven-safe skillet.",
            "Pour 1 inch of water into a saucepan and bring to a simmer. Set a large heatproof bowl on top to create a double boiler (do not let the bottom of the bowl touch the water). Put the bittersweet chocolate and butter in the bowl and gently melt. Stir until smooth.",
            "Remove from the heat and whisk in the sugar. Whisk in the eggs, one at a time, until combined and smooth. Carry on whisking in the maple syrup, vanilla, salt, baking powder, and cocoa powder until incorporated. Fold in the flour, pecans, and chocolate chips until the batter is smooth.",
            "Pour the batter into the prepared pan and bake for 35 to 40 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Let the brownie cool slightly in the pan for about 10 minutes, then serve with the ice cream, crushed pecans, and fresh mint. Delicious!"
