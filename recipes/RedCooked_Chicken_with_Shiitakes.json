            "Bring water, soy sauce, rice wine, brown sugar, ginger, garlic, tangerine peel, star anise, and 2 cups scallions to a boil in an 8-quart pot, then reduce heat and simmer 10 minutes. Add whole chicken and simmer, covered, turning once, until just cooked through, 50 to 60 minutes. Transfer chicken with a large slotted spoon to a platter and brush with sesame oil. Keep warm, covered with foil. Pour cooking liquid through a sieve into a large bowl, discarding solids. Skim fat from surface and reserve 1 cup cooking liquid. (Cool remainder, uncovered, then freeze.) Heat vegetable oil in a 12-inch heavy skillet over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking, then stir-fry shiitakes and remaining 2 cups scallions with salt, stirring frequently, until mushrooms are tender, 3 to 5 minutes. Add reserved cooking liquid and boil until reduced by half, about 3 minutes. Cut chicken into serving pieces and serve with sauce.",
