        "ingredients": [
            "1/3 cup unsalted margarine, melted and cooled, plus additional for greasing",
            "2 lb carrots (peeled), cut crosswise into 1-inch pieces (5 cups)",
            "1/4 cup matzo cake meal",
            "1/4 cup potato starch",
            "1/2 teaspoon salt",
            "3 large eggs, separated",
            "1/4 cup sugar",
            "1 teaspoon finely grated fresh orange zest",
            "1/4 teaspoon vanilla",
            "a muffin pan with 12 (1/2-cup) muffin cups"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Put oven rack in middle position and preheat oven to 350\u00b0F. Generously brush muffin cups with margarine.",
            "Cook carrots in boiling salted water in a 3- to 4-quart heavy saucepan, uncovered, until very tender, 15 to 20 minutes. Drain carrots in a colander and pur\u00e9e in a food processor until very smooth, about 1 minute.",
            "Whisk together matzo cake meal, potato starch, and salt in a small bowl.",
            "Beat together egg yolks, sugar, zest, and vanilla in a large bowl with an electric mixer at high speed until thick and pale, about 3 minutes. Reduce speed to low and mix in cake-meal mixture until just combined. Add carrot pur\u00e9e and 1/3 cup margarine and mix until just combined.",
            "Beat whites in another large bowl with cleaned beaters until they just hold stiff peaks. Fold one third of whites into carrot mixture to lighten, then fold in remaining whites gently but thoroughly.",
            "Divide batter among muffin cups, then rap tin once or twice on work surface to eliminate any large air bubbles. Bake until browned on edges and a wooden pick or skewer inserted into center of a carrot cup comes out clean, 40 to 45 minutes. Cool in pan on a rack 5 minutes, then run a knife around edges of carrot cups and turn out onto a serving dish. Serve warm."
