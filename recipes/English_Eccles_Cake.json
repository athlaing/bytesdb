            "4 tablespoons unsalted butter",
            "1 cup dried currants",
            "2 tablespoons candied mixed fruit peel, chopped",
            "1/2 cup white sugar, plus extra for decoration",
            "1/2 cup dark brown sugar",
            "1/2 teaspoon allspice",
            "1/4 teaspoon nutmeg",
            "1/4 teaspoon cinnamon",
            "1/2 (17.5-ounce) package frozen puff pastry, thawed",
            "1/4 cup whole milk",
            "1 large egg, beaten"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "1. Preheat oven to 400\u00b0F. Thoroughly grease a large baking sheet.",
            "2. Melt butter in a small saucepan over medium heat. Stir in currants, fruit peel, white sugar, brown sugar, allspice, nutmeg, and cinnamon. Mix thoroughly until sugar is dissolved and fruit is coated. Remove from heat.",
            "3. Roll out thawed pastry on a clean, lightly-floured surface until it is 1/4-inch thick. Cut out eight circles, each roughly 5 inches in diameter; set aside remaining pastry dough for use in other recipes. Divide currant mixture evenly between circles, then moisten edges of pastries with a little bit of milk, fold together, and pinch to seal.",
            "4. Turn pastries upside down onto floured surface and carefully roll out to make a wider and flatter pastry. Be careful not to break the dough.",
            "5. Brush cakes with beaten egg, then sprinkle with white sugar. Make three parallel cuts across the top of each cake, then place on greased baking sheet.",
            "6. Bake pastries in preheated oven for 15-20 minutes or until golden brown. Remove and sprinkle with a little more sugar, then serve."
