        "ingredients": [
            "1 tablespoon olive oil",
            "1 cup coarsely chopped onions",
            "1 3/4 cups cooked navy or cannellini beans or 1 (15-ounce) can navy or cannellini beans, drained (rinsed if nonorganic)",
            "1 (10-ounce) package frozen spinach",
            "1 cup water",
            "1 tablespoon instant vegetable stock powder",
            "2 teaspoons dried dill or 1/8 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg",
            "1/2 teaspoon salt, or to taste",

        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Heat the oil in a medium saucepan. Saut\u00e9 the onions for 1 minute, stirring frequently. Add the beans, spinach, water, stock powder, dill, and salt and bring to a boil over high heat. Cover and cook over medium heat for 5 minutes.",
            "Break up the block of spinach with a fork and stir well. Cook until the spinach is tender, 3 to 5 minutes. Puree the mixture with an immersion blender (or transfer in small batches to a food processor or blender and puree until smooth).",
            "If the creamed spinach seems too thick, thin slightly with lemon juice, which will sharpen the flavors, or with water. Season with pepper to taste. Depending upon the consistency, serve either in small bowls or on plates."
