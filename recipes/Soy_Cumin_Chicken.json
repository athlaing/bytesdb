            "Stir together soy sauce, Sherry, sugar, vegetable oil, garlic, sesame oil, cumin, and red-pepper flakes in a large glass measure until sugar is dissolved. Divide chicken pieces among 3 large sealable bags, then divide marinade among bags and seal, pressing out excess air. Put bags in a large bowl (in case of leaks) and marinate chicken, chilled, 2 hours. Put oven racks in upper and lower thirds of oven and preheat oven to 450\u00b0F. Line 2 large shallow baking pans (18 by 12 by 1 inch) with foil and brush foil with some of oil. Transfer chicken pieces with tongs to a large bowl and pour marinade into a 4-quart wide saucepan. Divide half of chicken between pans, skin sides down, without touching, and roast chicken in oven 12 minutes. Loosen cooked chicken with a metal spatula (browned chicken may stick to foil; don't worry if some skin is left behind), then turn chicken over and switch position of pans. Continue to roast until cooked through and lightly browned, 13 to 18 minutes more. Transfer chicken to platter (do not cover). Discard foil, then line pans with new foil and brush foil with oil. Divide remaining chicken between pans, skin sides down, without touching, and roast in oven 12 minutes. Loosen chicken with spatula, then turn chicken over and switch position of pans. Continue to roast until cooked through and lightly browned, 13 to 18 minutes more. Transfer to a large platter (do not cover). While chicken roasts, gently boil marinade until reduced to about 1 1/2 cups, 20 to 25 minutes. Drizzle chicken with some of sauce and serve remainder on the side. Squeeze juice from lime half all over chicken before serving.",
