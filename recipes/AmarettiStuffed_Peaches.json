        "ingredients": [
            "1/2 stick (1/4 cup) unsalted butter, softened",
            "1 cup coarsely crumbled amaretti (Italian almond macaroons, preferably Lazzaroni brand)",
            "2 1/2 tablespoons all-purpose flour",
            "2 tablespoons sugar",
            "1/8 teaspoon salt",
            "1 large egg",
            "8 firm-ripe small peaches (about 2 lb), halved lengthwise and pitted",
            "Accompaniment: mascarpone cheese or cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Put oven rack in middle position and preheat oven to 350\u00b0F.",
            "Melt 2 tablespoons butter and pour into a 13- by 9-inch glass or ceramic baking dish.",
            "Pulse 3/4 cup crumbled amaretti in a food processor until finely chopped, then add flour, sugar, salt, and remaining 2 tablespoons butter. Blend until butter is incorporated, then add egg and blend until smooth.",
            "Scoop out just enough peach pulp from center of each peach half with a melon-ball cutter or a small spoon to create a 1-inch-deep cavity. Arrange peaches, cut sides up, in baking dish, then brush skins with melted butter from dish. Divide amaretti mixture among cavities, then sprinkle remaining 1/4 cup crumbled amaretti over filling. Bake until filling is puffed and crisp, 40 to 50 minutes. Serve warm or at room temperature."
