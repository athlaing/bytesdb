            "Heat oil in a 6-quart heavy pot over moderate heat until hot but not smoking, then cook shallots, ginger, garlic, and curry powder, stirring, until shallots are golden, about 2 minutes. Stir in wine, tarragon, and mussels and cook, covered, until mussels just open wide, checking frequently after 3 minutes and transferring opened mussels to a bowl. (Discard any mussels that remain unopened after 6 minutes.) Add stock, carrot juice, and clam juice to pot and bring to a simmer, stirring occasionally.",
