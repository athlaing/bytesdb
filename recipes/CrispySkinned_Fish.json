            "Dry Out",
            "Starting with parched skin is the key to a pro result\u2014 try to cook wet fish and it's going to steam, stick, rip, and generally be a huge, frustrating bummer. One hour before cooking, put your fillets on a plate, skin side up (no seasoning, please!), and leave them uncovered in the fridge to dry out.",
            "Start Smoking Get a large stainlesssteel skillet ripping hot over high heat (2 minutes should do it), then pour in 1 tablespoon oil and add a big pinch of salt. Once the oil is smoking, take the skillet off the heat and use a handful of paper towels to wipe oil and salt around and out of the pan (be extra careful\u2014you might want to use tongs to hold the towels).",

            "Give 'Em Some Skin Put your now-seasoned skillet back over high heat and take those beautiful air-dried fillets out of the fridge. Add another 1 tablespoon oil to the pan and hit both sides of each fillet with a decent amount of salt. Once the oil is shimmering, carefully lay a fillet skin side down in the pan (be sure to lay them going away from you to guard against spatters).",

            "Be Firm Use a fish spatula (call it a \"fish spat\" if you want to sound like a pro) to apply firm, even pressure to the fillet until it relaxes and lies flat. Repeat with remaining fillet, then keep at it! Periodically press down each fillet and cook until flesh is nearly opaque and cooked through, with just a small raw area on top.",
