        "instructions": [
            "Prepare grill for medium heat (or heat a grill pan over medium). Toss chiles, garlic, and a large pinch of salt in a small bowl. Let sit until just softened, 8\u201310 minutes. Stir vinegar and honey into hot sauce.",
            "Meanwhile, drizzle eggplants with 2 tablespoons oil; season with salt and pepper. Grill, turning occasionally, until lightly charred and tender, 6\u20138 minutes. Cut on a diagonal into thick slices; toss in a large bowl with scallions and half of hot sauce, cilantro, and dill. Transfer to a platter.",
            "Heat remaining 2 tablespoons oil in a medium skillet over medium-high. Add eggs; season with salt and pepper. Cook, rotating skillet occasionally, until whites are golden and crisp at the edges and set around the yolk (which should be runny), about 2 minutes. Flip and cook just until yolks begin to set, about 30 seconds. Cut eggs into strips; arrange over eggplants. Drizzle with remaining hot sauce; top with remaining cilantro and dill."
