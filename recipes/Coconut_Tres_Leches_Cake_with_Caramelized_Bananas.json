            "Sift the cake flour, baking powder and salt into a bowl. Cream the sugar, butter and banana pur\u00e9e in a mixing bowl until light and fluffy. Add 1/3 flour mixture and 1/3 skim milk alternately; mixing well after each addition. Mix in the vanilla and coconut extracts. Fold in the egg whites.

Remove from the oven and cool in the pan for 10 minutes. Remove to a wire rack to cool completely. Combine the condensed milk, 3/4 cup skim milk and coconut milk in a bowl; mix well. Arrange the cake on a serving platter. Poke holes all over the cake with a wooden pick or skewer. Spoon the milk mixture over the cake. Cover the cake and chill in the refrigerator for 4 hours. Combine the brown sugar and rum in a saucepan over medium heat. Cook until the mixture reduces to a syrupy consistency. Add the bananas and stir gently to coat the fruit. Remove from the heat and cool to room temperature. Top each serving of cake with whipped topping and a scattering of toasted coconut. Serve the bananas on the side.",
