        "ingredients": [
            "1 1/2 lb. very ripe red tomatoes, chopped",
            "1 small garlic clove, smashed",
            "3 Tbsp. unseasoned rice vinegar",
            "1 Tbsp. sugar",
            "1 Tbsp. plus 1 tsp. kosher salt, plus more",
            "10 oz. thin noodles (preferably somen)",
            "5 large eggs, beaten to blend",
            "1/2 Tbsp. unsalted butter",
            "2 medium Persian cucumbers, halved, thinly sliced on a diagonal",
            "3 scallions, thinly sliced",
            "1/2 cup cilantro leaves with tender stems",
            "Hot chili paste (such as sambal oelek; for serving)"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Blend tomatoes, garlic, vinegar, sugar, 1 Tbsp. salt, and 2 cups water in a blender on low speed until tomato pieces are no larger than 1/4\" (it\u2019s important to blend on low; otherwise, the tomato broth will foam up). Strain through a fine-mesh sieve into a large measuring cup, pressing on solids with a spoon to extract as much liquid as possible (you should have about 4 cups broth). Chill until ready to use. Meanwhile, cook noodles in a large pot of boiling salted water according to package directions. Drain and rinse under cold water. Cover with damp paper towels; set aside. Season beaten eggs with remaining 1/4 tsp. salt. Melt butter in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add half of beaten eggs and swirl around skillet to make a thin egg crepe. Cook undisturbed until completely set, about 2 minutes. Slide egg crepe onto a cutting board. Repeat with remaining egg mixture, placing second egg crepe right on top of the first one. When cool enough to handle, tightly roll up eggs. Thinly slice crosswise to create long shreds. Divide noodles among bowls. Pour tomato broth over, holding back any foam. Arrange shredded eggs, cucumbers, scallions, and cilantro in bowls. Serve with hot chili paste alongside. Do Ahead: Tomato broth can be made 2 days ahead. Transfer to an airtight container and chill.",
