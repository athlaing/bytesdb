            "Whisk egg yolk, garlic, and salt in a medium bowl to combine. Mix in 1 tsp. water. Whisking constantly, add oil, drop by drop at first, then 1/8-teaspoonful at a time as mixture emulsifies and thickens. (Do not add oil too quickly or aioli will break and oil will separate.) Whisk until oil is incorporated and aioli is stiff enough to hold its shape when spooned.",
