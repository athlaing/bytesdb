        "title": "Roast Chicken with Bell Peppers, Lemon, and Thyme ",
        "ingredients": [
            "4 large bell peppers (any color)",
            "1 large shallot, thinly sliced",
            "1 Fresno chile, thinly sliced crosswise",
            "5 sprigs thyme, divided",
            "Kosher salt, freshly ground pepper",
            "1/4 cup plus 1 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil",
            "1 (3 1/2\u20134-lb.) chicken, patted dry",
            "1 lemon, halved"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Place a rack in middle of oven; preheat to 425\u00b0F. Heat a large ovenproof skillet, preferably cast iron, over medium-high. Cook bell peppers in skillet, turning every minute or two, until blistered in several spots, about 5 minutes. (You aren\u2019t trying to cook them, just get some color on them.) Transfer bell peppers to a cutting board and let cool slightly; reserve skillet. Stand a pepper upright and slice off sides, working your way around stem in 3 or 4 cuts. Pull out ribs and seeds; discard along with stems. Repeat with remaining peppers. Return peppers to skillet and add shallot, chile, and 3 thyme sprigs. Season generously with salt and black pepper and drizzle 1/4 cup oil over. Season chicken all over with salt and black pepper and set on top of peppers. Place a lemon half and remaining 2 thyme sprigs in chicken cavity and rub skin all over with remaining 1 Tbsp. oil. Roast in oven until skin is golden brown and crisp all over and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of breast registers 160\u00b0F, 60\u201380 minutes. Remove from oven (be careful; handle is hot!) and let rest 15 minutes before transferring chicken to a cutting board and carving. Just before serving, squeeze remaining lemon half over chicken and bell peppers.",
