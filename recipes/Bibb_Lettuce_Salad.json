        "ingredients": [
            "4 heads Bibb lettuce",
            "Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper",
            "2 tablespoons minced shallots",
            "2 tablespoons minced chives",
            "1/4 cup Italian parsley leaves",
            "1/4 cup tarragon leaves",
            "1/4 cup chervil leaves",
            "1/2 cup House Vinaigrette",
            "1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon fresh lemon juice"
        ],
        "instructions": [
            "Carefully cut out the core from each head of lettuce and separate the leaves, but keep each head of lettuce together; discard any tough outer leaves. Because each head of lettuce will be reassembled, the easiest way to work is with one head at a time. First, place the leaves in a bowl of cold water to refresh them and remove any dirt, then lift out and spin-dry in a salad spinner.",
            "Place the leaves from a single head of lettuce in a bowl. Sprinkle with a pinch of salt, a few grinds of pepper, 1 1/2 teaspoons of the shallots and chives, and 1 tablespoon each of the parsley, tarragon, and chervil. Then toss gently with 2 tablespoons of the vinaigrette and 1 teaspoon of lemon juice. Repeat with the remaining heads.",
            "For each serving, arrange the outer lettuce leaves as a base on the plate and rebuild each head of lettuce, ending with the smallest, most tender leaves."
